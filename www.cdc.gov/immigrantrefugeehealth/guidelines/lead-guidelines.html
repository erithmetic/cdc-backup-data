Although children from all regions of the world are at risk for having elevated BLL upon entering the United States, this risk appears to vary to some degree. In an analysis of new arrival screening data from Massachusetts from the mid- to late 1990s, the prevalence of elevated BLL among newly arrived refugee children under 7 years old was 7%, 25%, 27%, 37%, and 40% among those from Northern Eurasian countries, the Near East (predominately Iraq), Africa, Asia (predominately Vietnam), and Central American/Caribbean countries, respectively. None of 33 Bosnian children born in Germany had elevated BLL. This finding suggests that birthplace and other areas lived are more important predictors of elevated lead levels than ethnicity. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref3">3</a></sup> In 2009, BLL was tested in 642 Burmese children from refugee camps in Thailand before they departed for the United States. Among children ages 6 months through 14 years, 5% had elevated BLLs(&#8805;10 &#181;g/dL). Among those under 2 years of age, the rate of elevated BLL was as high as 15%. In the younger age group, anemia with hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL, exposure to lead acid car batteries, and use of traditional remedies were found to be associated with elevated BLL. Putting cosmetic products in the mouth was also a suspected contributor. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref4">4</a></sup> In many areas of the world where refugees originate, potential lead exposures include lead-containing gasoline combustion; industrial emissions; ammunition manufacturing and use; burning of fossil fuels and waste; and lead-containing traditional remedies, foods, ceramics, and utensils.<sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref2">2,3,4</a></sup></p><p>In addition, refugee children are at above average risk for lead poisoning from ongoing exposures once in the United States since they often settle into high-risk areas with older housing. Ongoing lead exposure among refugee children within the United States has been well documented. Anywhere from 6-29% of children who have normal BLL at new arrival screening may have elevated BLLs when retested several weeks to months later, based on reports from Massachusetts and New Hampshire. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref3">3</a>,<a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref5">5</a></sup> In New Hampshire, malnutrition was fairly common among children with elevated BLL (22% had low weight for their height and 35% had low height for their age at the time of repeat testing). The median age of those with elevated BLL on repeat testing was 4.9 years (range 14 months-13 years), which is considerably older than the ages of recommended screening for most children in the United States. The most common lead exposure identified among children with elevated BLL at repeat testing was lead-based paints and lead-contaminated soil where the children had played. Of the refugee children in New Hampshire with BLLs &gt;15 mcg/dL, 89% lived in rental homes built before 1978 when lead-based paints were still used. Furthermore, two-thirds of the parents reported witnessing their children partaking in behaviors that may increase lead exposure such as pica (craving and eating nonfood items), picking at loose paint, plaster, or putty; or chewing on painted surfaces. Investigators also noted limited parental awareness of the dangers associated with lead exposure. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref5">5</a></sup></p><p>In addition to exposure to lead-based paints and contaminated soil, refugee children are vulnerable to other unique sources of lead exposure. A variety of foods, candies, and traditional therapies have been found to be the source of exposure for many refugee children. <a href="lead-guidelines.html#table1">(Table 1)</a></p><h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="Immigrant and Refugee Populations at Risk" name="Immigrant and Refugee Populations at Risk" title="Immigrant and Refugee Populations at Risk"></a>Immigrant and Refugee Populations at Risk</h3><ul><li>Refugee children from all regions of the world, especially those from resource-poor countries, are at risk of having lead poisoning upon their arrival in the United States.</li><li>Malnourished children may be at increased risk for lead poisoning, likely through increased intestinal lead absorption mediated by micronutrient deficiencies. The best studied micronutrient deficiency related to lead levels is iron deficiency. Iron deficient children are at increased risk of developing lead poisoning. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref6">6</a></sup> Deficiencies in calcium and zinc may also increase a child&#8217;s risk. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref7">7</a></sup></li></ul><p><strong>Clinical Presentation</strong></p><p>From 1991-2011, the value indicating elevated BLL was &#8805;10 mcg/dL. Above this value, lead is known to impair intelligence and neurodevelopment. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref8">8</a></sup> However, more recent studies have called into question whether levels lower than 10 mcg/dL are safe. The results of one study suggest that the magnitude of the decrease in intelligent quotient (IQ) for each incremental increase in BLL is greatest among those children with levels below 10 mcg/dL. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref9">9</a></sup> In 2011, in response to the 
		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/CDC_Response_Lead_Exposure_Recs.pdf">Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Recommendations [PDF - 16 pages]</a>
	 , CDC issued a policy statement stating that the BLL indicating high lead exposure (&quot;reference value&quot;) will be revised every four years based on the 97.5th percentile identified in the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES). <em>Based on these criteria, the current cutoff value that CDC currently recommends for action and reporting is &#8805;5 mcg/dL.</em></p><p>At higher levels, acute symptoms of toxicity may appear. Above a level of 60 mcg/dL, individuals may experience headaches, abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, clumsiness, agitation, and lethargy. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref9">9</a></sup> At a level of 70 mcg/dL, children may develop severe neurological complications, including seizures, ataxia, mental status changes, coma, and death. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref7">7</a></sup> Although such severe poisonings are now rare, the death of a two-year-old Sudanese refugee girl with a BLL of 392 mcg/dL--the first lead-poisoning-related death in the US in a 10-year period--five weeks after her arrival in the United States in 2000 underscores the unique vulnerability of refugee children to this condition. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref10">10</a></sup></p><h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="Elevated Blood Levels" name="Elevated Blood Levels" title="Evaluation and Treatment of Persons with Elevated Blood Levels"></a>Evaluation and Treatment of Persons with Elevated Blood Levels</h2><p>An in-depth discussion of the clinical management of elevated BLL is beyond the scope of this document. Information on case management and follow-up of elevated BLL is available from the CDC at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/CaseManagement/caseManage_main.htm">Managing Elevated Blood Lead Levels Among Young Children: Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention.</a> <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref11">11</a></sup> The key recommendations from this reference, including history taking, medical management, environmental assessments, and follow-up testing, are summarized below. The new reference value does not change previous recommendations for children with blood lead levels &#8805; 10 &#181;g/dL. Further guidance for BLLs &lt;10 can be found at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/blood_lead_levels.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/blood_lead_levels.htm.</a></p><p>The medical and environmental exposure history can give clues to potential lead exposure <a href="lead-guidelines.html#table2">(Table 2)</a>, which should be assessed in a culturally sensitive manner. If no lead sources can be identified in children with lead poisoning, clinicians should consider checking BLLs in other family members. If other family members of various ages have elevated levels, shared source exposures, such as ceramicware, spices, foods, or remedies, may be present. <sup><a href="lead-guidelines.html#ref12">12,13,14,15</a>&#160;</sup> <a href="lead-guidelines.html#table1">(Tabe 1)</a></p><p>Appropriate management of children with confirmed (venous) elevated BLLs is based on the extent of the elevation. Continued follow-up testing is mandatory for all children with documented elevated venous BLLs, in addition to all refugee children aged 6 months-6 years, regardless of their initial level.</p><h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="Post-Arrival" name="Post-Arrival" title="Recommendations for Post-Arrival Lead Screening"></a>Recommendations for Post-Arrival Lead Screening</h2><ol><li>Check BLL of all refugee children <strong>6 months&#8211;16 years of age</strong> upon their arrival in the United States (generally within 90 days, preferably within 30 days of arrival).</li><li>Within 3&#8211;6 months post-resettlement, a follow-up blood lead test should be conducted on all refugee children aged <strong>6 months&#8211;6 years of age</strong>, regardless of the initial screening BLL result.</li><li>Within 90 days of their arrival in the United States, children aged <strong>6 months&#8211;6 years of age</strong> should also undergo nutritional assessment and testing for hemoglobin or hematocrit level with one or more of the following: mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with the red cell distribution width (RDW), ferritin, transferrin saturation, or reticulocyte hemoglobin content.
