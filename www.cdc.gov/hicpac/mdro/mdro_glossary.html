                  <h1>Glossary - Multidrug-Resistant Organisms</h1>


<p><strong>Ambulatory care settings.</strong> Facilities that provide health care to patients who do not remain
overnight (e.g., hospital-based outpatient clinics, nonhospital-based clinics and physician
offices, urgent care centers, surgicenters, free-standing dialysis centers, public health
clinics, imaging centers, ambulatory behavioral health and substance abuse clinics, physical
therapy and rehabilitation centers, and dental practices.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cohorting. </strong>In the context of this guideline, this term applies to the practice of grouping
patients infected or colonized with the same infectious agent together to confine their care
to one area and prevent contact with susceptible patients (cohorting patients). During
outbreaks, healthcare personnel may be assigned to a cohort of patients to further limit
opportunities for transmission (cohorting staff).</p>
<p>
<strong>Contact Precautions.</strong> Contact Precautions are a set of practices used to prevent
transmission of infectious agents that are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient
or the patient's environment. Contact Precautions also apply where the presence of
excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other discharges from the body suggest
an increased transmission risk. A single patient room is preferred for patients who require
Contact Precautions. When a single patient room is not available, consultation with infection
control is helpful to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options
(e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). In multi-patient rooms, >3
feet spatial separation of between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for
inadvertent sharing of items between the infected/colonized patient and other patients.
Healthcare personnel caring for patients on Contact Precautions wear a gown and gloves
for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated
areas in the patient's environment. Donning of gown and gloves upon room entry, removal
before exiting the patient room and performance of hand hygiene immediately upon exiting
are done to contain pathogens.</p>
<p>
<strong>Epidemiologically important pathogens.</strong> Infectious agents that have one or more of the
following characteristics: 1)A propensity for transmission within healthcare facilities based
on published reports and the occurrence of temporal or geographic clusters of > 2 patients,
(e.g., VRE, MRSA and MSSA, Clostridium difficile, norovirus, RSV, influenza, rotavirus,
Enterobacter spp; Serratia spp., group A streptococcus). However, for group A
streptococcus, most experts consider a single case of healthcare-associated disease a
trigger for investigation and enhanced control measures because of the devastating
outcomes associated with HAI group A streptococcus infections. For susceptible bacteria
that are known to be associated with asymptomatic colonization, isolation from normally
sterile body fluids in patients with significant clinical disease would be the trigger to consider
the organism as epidemiologically important. 2) Antimicrobial resistance implications:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Resistance to first-line therapies (e.g., MRSA, VRE, VISA, VRSA, ESBLproducing
    organisms).    </li>
  <li> Unusual or usual agents with unusual patterns of resistance within a facility,
    (e.g., the first isolate of Burkholderia cepacia complex or Ralstonia spp. in
    non-CF patients or a quinolone-resistant strain of Pseudomonas in a facility.    </li>
  <li> Difficult to treat because of innate or acquired resistance to multiple classes of
    antimicrobial agents (e.g., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp.).    </li>
</ul>
<p>3) Associated with serious clinical disease, increased morbidity and mortality (e.g., MRSA
    and MSSA, group A streptococcus); or 4) A newly discovered or reemerging pathogen. The
    strategies described for MDROs may be applied for control of epidemiologically important
    organisms other than MDROs.</p>
<p>
<strong>Hand hygiene. </strong>A general term that applies to any one of the following: 1) handwashing with
plain (nonantimicrobial) soap and water); 2) antiseptic hand wash (soap containing
antiseptic agents and water); 3) antiseptic hand rub (waterless antiseptic product, most
often alcohol-based, rubbed on all surfaces of hands); or 4) surgical hand antisepsis
(antiseptic hand wash or antiseptic hand rub performed preoperatively by surgical personnel
to eliminate transient hand flora and reduce resident hand flora).</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare-associated infection (HAI).</strong> An infection that develops in a patient who is cared
for in any setting where healthcare is delivered (e.g., acute care hospital, chronic care
facility, ambulatory clinic, dialysis center, surgicenter, home) and is related to receiving
health care (i.e., was not incubating or present at the time healthcare was provided). In
ambulatory and home settings, HAI would apply to any infection that is associated with a
medical or surgical intervention performed in those settings.</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare epidemiologist</strong> A person whose primary training is medical (M.D., D.O.) and/or
masters or doctorate-level epidemiology who has received advanced training in healthcare
epidemiology. Typically these professionals direct or provide consultation to an infection
prevention and control program in a hospital, long term care facility (LTCF), or healthcare
delivery system (also see infection prevention and control professional).</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare personnel (HCP).</strong> All paid and unpaid persons who work in a healthcare
setting, also known as healthcare workers (e.g. any person who has professional or
technical training in a healthcare-related field and provides patient care in a healthcare
setting or any person who provides services that support the delivery of healthcare such as
dietary, housekeeping, engineering, maintenance personnel).</p>
<p>
<strong>Home care.</strong> A wide-range of medical, nursing, rehabilitation, hospice, and social services
delivered to patients in their place of residence (e.g., private residence, senior living center,
assisted living facility). Home health-care services include care provided by home health
aides and skilled nurses, respiratory therapists, dieticians, physicians, chaplains, and
volunteers; provision of durable medical equipment; home infusion therapy; and physical,
speech, and occupational therapy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Infection prevention and control professional (ICP).</strong> A person whose primary training is
in either nursing, medical technology, microbiology, or epidemiology and who has acquired
specialized training in infection control. Responsibilities may include collection, analysis, and
feedback of infection data and trends to healthcare providers; consultation on infection risk
assessment, prevention and control strategies; performance of education and training
activities; implementation of evidence-based infection control practices or those mandated
by regulatory and licensing agencies; application of epidemiologic principles to improve
patient outcomes; participation in planning renovation and construction projects (e.g., to
ensure appropriate containment of construction dust); evaluation of new products or
procedures on patient outcomes; oversight of employee health services related to infection
prevention; implementation of preparedness plans; communication within the healthcare
setting, with local and state health departments, and with the community at large concerning
infection control issues; and participation in research.</p>
<p>
<strong>Infection prevention and control program.</strong> A multidisciplinary program that includes a
group of activities to ensure that recommended practices for the prevention of healthcareassociated
infections are implemented and followed by healthcare personnel, making the
healthcare setting safe from infection for patients and healthcare personnel. The Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requires the following
five components of an infection prevention and control program for accreditation: 1)
surveillance: monitoring patients and healthcare personnel for acquisition of infection and/or
colonization; 2) investigation: identification and analysis of infection problems or undesirable
trends; 3) prevention: implementation of measures to prevent transmission of infectious
agents and to reduce risks for device- and procedure-related infections; 4) control:
evaluation and management of outbreaks; and 5) reporting: provision of information to
external agencies as required by state and federal law and regulation (www.jcaho.org). The
infection prevention and control program staff has the ultimate authority to determine
infection control policies for a healthcare organization with the approval of the organization's
governing body.</p>
<p>
<strong>Long-term care facilities (LTCFs).</strong> An array of residential and outpatient facilities designed
to meet the bio-psychosocial needs of persons with sustained self-care deficits. These
include skilled nursing facilities, chronic disease hospitals, nursing homes, foster and group
homes, institutions for the developmentally disabled, residential care facilities, assisted
living facilities, retirement homes, adult day health care facilities, rehabilitation centers, and
long-term psychiatric hospitals.</p>
<p>
<strong>Mask.</strong> A term that applies collectively to items used to cover the nose and mouth and
includes both procedure masks and surgical masks
(www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/094.html#a4).</p>
<p>
<strong>Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs).</strong> In general, bacteria (excluding M. tuberculosis)
that are resistant to one or more classes of antimicrobial agents and usually are resistant to
all but one or two commercially available antimicrobial agents (e.g., MRSA, VRE, extended
spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producing or intrinsically resistant gram-negative bacilli).</p>
<p><strong>Nosocomial infection. </strong>Derived from two Greek words &quot;nosos&quot; (disease) and &quot;komeion&quot; (to
  take care of). Refers to any infection that develops during or as a result of an admission to
  an acute care facility (hospital) and was not incubating at the time of admission.  </p>
<p><strong>Standard Precautions.</strong> A group of infection prevention practices that apply to all patients,
  regardless of suspected or confirmed diagnosis or presumed infection status. Standard
  Precautions are a combination and expansion of Universal Precautions and Body
  Substance Isolation. Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body
  fluids, secretions, excretions except sweat, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may
  contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions includes hand hygiene, and
  depending on the anticipated exposure, use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face
  shield. Also, equipment or items in the patient environment likely to have been
  contaminated with infectious fluids must be handled in a manner to prevent transmission of
  infectious agents, (e.g. wear gloves for handling, contain heavily soiled equipment, properly
  clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equipment before use on another patient).</p>
