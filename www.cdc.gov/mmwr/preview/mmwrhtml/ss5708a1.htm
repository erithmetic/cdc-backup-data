</h3><P><b>Problem/Condition:</b> Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death in the 
United States. The 2004 Surgeon General report found convincing evidence for a direct causal relationship 
between tobacco use and the following cancers: lung and bronchial, laryngeal, oral cavity and pharyngeal, 
esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, and cervical cancers and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This report provides state-level cancer incidence data and recent trends for cancers 
associated with tobacco use. Because information on tobacco use was not available in the databases of the National 
Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, cases of 
cancer included in this report might or might not be in persons who used tobacco; however, the cancer types included 
in this report are those defined by the U.S. Surgeon General as having a direct causal relationship with tobacco 
use (i.e., referred to as tobacco-related cancer in this report). These data are important for initiation, monitoring, 
and evaluation of targeted tobacco prevention and control measures.
</P><P><b>Reporting Period Covered:</b> 1999--2004.
</P><P><b>Description of Systems:</b> Data were obtained from cancer registries affiliated with CDC's NPCR and 
the National Cancer Institute's SEER program; combined, these data cover approximately 92% of the 
U.S. population. Combined data from the NPCR and SEER programs provide the best source of information 
on population-based cancer incidence for the nation and are the only source of information for 41 states 
(including the District of Columbia) with cancer surveillance programs that are funded solely by NPCR. This 
report provides age-adjusted cancer incidence rates by demographic and geographic 
characteristics, percentage distributions for tumor characteristics, and trends in cancer incidence by sex.
</P><P><b>Results:</b> Approximately 2.4 million cases of tobacco-related cancer were diagnosed during 1999--2004. 
Age-adjusted incidence rates ranged from 4.0 per 100,000 
persons (for AML) to 69.4 (for lung and bronchial 
cancer). High rates occurred among men, black and non-Hispanic populations, and older adults. Higher incidence 
rates of lung and laryngeal cancer occurred in the South compared with other regions, particularly the West, 
consistent with high smoking patterns in the South.
</P><P><b>Interpretation:</b> The high rates of tobacco-related cancer observed among men, blacks, non-Hispanics, and 
older adults reflect overall demographic patterns of cancer incidence in the United States and reflect patterns of 
tobacco use.
</P><P><b>Public Health Action:</b> The findings in this report emphasize the need for ongoing surveillance and reporting 
to monitor cancer incidence trends, identify populations at greatest risk for developing cancer related to 
tobacco use, and evaluate the effectiveness of targeted tobacco control programs and policies.

</h3>
</H3>
		<P>Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death in the United States, resulting in an 
estimated 438,000 premature deaths annually, or nearly one of every five deaths each year 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5425a1.htm">1</a></I>). This estimate includes approximately 38,000 deaths attributed to exposure to secondhand smoke 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5425a1.htm">1</a></I>), which contains at least 250 chemicals known to be toxic 
(<I>2</I>). Forms of tobacco used in the United States include cigarettes, cigars, pipes, nonconventional imported cigarettes (e.g., 
bidis and kreteks [clove cigarettes]), and smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff or chewing tobacco) 
(<I>3</I>). Tobacco use causes more deaths each year than alcohol use, car crashes, suicide, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), homicide, and illegal drug 
use combined (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5425a1.htm">1</a>,4</I>). In addition, smoking accounts for $167 billion annually in health care expenditures and productivity 
losses (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5425a1.htm">1</a></I>).
</P><P>In the 1950s, the epidemiologic evidence of an association between smoking and lung cancer began to emerge, signaling 
one of the first warnings of smoking as a cause of cancer and other diseases 
(<I>5,6</I>). In a landmark report by Surgeon General 
Luther L. Terry's committee in 1964, the relationship between smoking and lung cancer in men was first classified as causal 
(<I>7</I>). Subsequent Surgeon General reports have concluded that smoking causes cancer in many other organ sites, including 
the urinary bladder, esophagus, kidney and renal pelvis, larynx, lung and bronchus, oral cavity and pharynx (OCP), and 
pancreas (<I>7--16</I>). In 2004, the Surgeon General expanded the sites to include cancers of the stomach and cervix and acute 
myelogenous leukemia (AML) (<I>17</I>). Thirty percent of cancer deaths, including 87% of lung cancer deaths, are attributable to tobacco 
use (<I>17,18</I>). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) also reviewed the evidence on tobacco and cancer in 
1986 and in 2002 (<I>19,20</I>). Although the methodology used by IARC differs from that in the Surgeon General reports, 
their conclusions generally have been similar.
</P><P>Since the release of the first report of the Surgeon General in 1964, cigarette use and the prevalence of smoking in 
the United States have decreased. Today, more former smokers exist than current smokers, and each year approximately half of 
all daily smokers try to quit (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5240a1.htm">21</a></I>). The decrease in tobacco use since 1964 has been described as one of the 10 
greatest achievements in public health in the 20th century 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843a2.htm">22</a></I>); however, this rate of progress is unlikely to continue. Trends 
suggest that the annual rate of cessation among smokers remains fairly low, that the decrease in the smoking initiation rate might 
have slowed, and that overall adult smoking prevalence might remain at approximately 20%; however, prevalence 
varies substantially by race and ethnicity 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5644a2.htm">23</a></I>). Although advances have been made in knowledge of tobacco use and its 
health consequences, intervention strategies to reduce tobacco use must continue.
</P><P>Ongoing surveillance of cancer associated with tobacco use is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of tobacco 
control programs and policies and identify populations that would benefit from targeted cessation intervention programs or 
policies. Cancer incidence data are an important resource used in the prevention and control of cancer 
(<I>24</I>); these data have been used previously at the state level to measure the effectiveness of cigarette tax implementation and smoking restrictions 
(<I>25</I>). In the analysis described in this report, data were obtained from cancer registries affiliated with CDC's National Program of 
Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER) program to describe the incidence of tobacco-related cancers in the United States. Results are presented by demographic and 
tumor characteristics and by state and U.S. census region. In addition, recent trends in cancer incidence are described. 
Combined data from the NPCR and SEER programs provide the best source of information on 
population-based cancer incidence for the nation and the only source of information for 41 states (including the District of 
Columbia [DC]) with cancer surveillance programs that are funded solely by NPCR.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Methods</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>Data on new cases of cancer diagnosed during 1999--2004 and collected by cancer registries affiliated with the NPCR 
or SEER programs were included in analyses. Tobacco-related cancers were defined according to the 2004 report of the 
Surgeon General on <I>The Health Consequences of Smoking 
(17),</I> in which evidence was determined to be sufficient to infer a 
causal relationship between tobacco use and the following cancers (with corresponding site and morphology codes according to 
the <I>International Classification of Diseases for 
Oncology</I>, third edition [ICD-O-3]): lung and bronchus (C34), larynx (C32), 
OCP (C0-14), esophagus (C15), stomach (C16), pancreas (C25), kidney and renal pelvis (C64--65), urinary bladder (C67), 
cervix (C53), and AML (M9840, 9861, 9866, 9867, 9871--9874, 9891, 9895--9897, 9910, 9920) 
(<I>26,27</I>). Because information on tobacco use was not available in the NPCR or SEER databases, cases of cancer included in this report might or might not 
be 

in persons who used tobacco; however, the cancer types included in this report are those defined as 
tobacco related by the Surgeon General (i.e., having a direct causal relationship with tobacco use). CDC analyzed the most recent data available: 
data reported to NPCR as of January 31, 2007, and to SEER as of November 2006 and made available through a limited-use 
data file in April 2007.
</P><P>For demographic, tumor, and trend analyses (<a href="ss5708a1.htm#tab1">Tables 1</a>--<a href="ss5708a1.htm#tab11">11</a>), diagnoses during 1999--2004 from 44 states and DC 
were included because data from these states and DC for this time period were considered high quality according to the 
<I>United States Cancer Statistics</I> publication criteria 
(<I>27</I>); these data represent 92.1% of the U.S. population. For state and 
regional analyses (<a href="ss5708a1.htm#fig1">Figures 1</a>--<a href="ss5708a1.htm#fig19">19</a>), diagnoses from 2004 from 49 states and DC were used. Using a single year of data resulted in 
a greater number of states with high-quality data 
(<I>27</I>); these data represent 98.1% of the U.S. population. For the U.S. 
Census regions, these data represent 100% of the U.S. population for the Northeast, Midwest, and West and 94.1% for 
the South. U.S. Census regions were defined according to the U.S. Census Bureau (available at 
		<a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/geographic">http://www.census.gov/popest/geographic</a>).
</P><P>Other than for urinary bladder cancer, only cases of invasive cancer were included. Cases of urinary bladder cancer 
include in situ tumors that are routinely recoded as invasive for the purpose of cancer incidence reporting because of 
historical difficulties in distinguishing between the two types 
(<I>28</I>). Only microscopically confirmed cancer cases were included 
in tumor analyses (i.e., histology, stage, and grade).
</P><P>Rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for age, race, ethnicity, and sex. Data for 
American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) were cross-checked with Indian Health Service (IHS) records to decrease the number of 
AI/ANs who were misclassified as nonnative 
(<I>29</I>). The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries 
Hispanic Identification Algorithm was applied to Hispanic ethnicity data to reduce misclassification of Hispanics as 
being of unknown ethnicity. Incidence rates, per 100,000 persons, are age adjusted by 19 age groups to the 2000 U.S. standard population by 
the direct method (<I>27</I>). Population estimates used as denominators in the rate calculations are from the U.S. Census Bureau 
and modified by SEER to increase the accuracy of rates 
(<I>27</I>). The SEER modification is used to reduce the estimated 
white population and increases the estimated Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI) population for Hawaii because of concerns that 
the Native Hawaiian population has been substantially undercounted in previous censuses. The estimates for the total 
population, black population, and AI/AN populations in Hawaii are not modified. Statistical testing for differences in rates was 
not performed because of issues with multiple comparisons. CIs were calculated as modified gamma intervals 
(<I>30</I>) and are presented to allow for informal comparisons among rates. Although examining overlap between CIs to determine 
significance is conservative (<I>31</I>), the power for detecting differences in rates with this method is still very high with 6 years of 
national data. All rate calculations were performed using 
SEER*Stat (available at <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat">http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat</a>).
</P><P>Percentages for tumor characteristics (i.e., histology, stage, and grade) were calculated for all cancer types except 
AML. Histology categories were organized according to ICD-O-3 morphology codes 
(<I>26</I>). Cystic, mucinous, and serous adenocarcinomas were combined into one adenocarcinoma category. Histology categories for each cancer site were 
determined by incidence or clinical relevance. Cancer cases were staged as localized, regional, distant, or unknown* using the 2000 
SEER summary staging system, a system routinely used by cancer registries, incorporating information from the American 
Joint Committee on Cancer staging system 
(<I>32</I>). Because SEER summary staging guidelines changed substantially beginning 
with diagnoses made in 2001 (<I>32</I>) and the method used by registries to stage cases changed in 2004, all stage analyses were 
limited to diagnoses occurring during 2001--2003. For urinary bladder cancer cases, the localized stage includes in situ cases.
</P><P>Linear trends in the age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated as an estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) 
during the study period (1999--2004) using the weighted least squares method in SEER*Stat. P values &lt;0.05 for the 
two-sided hypothesis test that the EAPC is equal to zero were considered statistically significant.

<B>Lung and Bronchial Cancer</B>
</H4>
</P><P>A total of 1,095,305 lung and bronchial cancer cases (69.4 per 100,000 persons) were diagnosed in the United States 
during 1999--2004 (<a href = "ss5708a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). Incidence rates were substantially higher among men (89.6) compared with women (54.7). 
Among persons aged &lt;80 years, rates increased with increasing age and peaked among persons aged 70--79 years (424.4). 
Among men, blacks had the highest rates (111.0), followed by white men (88.7). A/PI and AI/AN men had similar rates (52.9 
and 

52.8, respectively). Among women, whites had the highest rates (56.0), followed by blacks (50.3), AI/ANs (35.7), and 
A/PIs (27.2). Rates were nearly two times higher among non-Hispanics compared with Hispanics (71.8 and 37.4, 
respectively). Among those with known tumor characteristics, a total of 75.5% of all lung and bronchial cancer cases were non--small 
cell carcinomas. Men had greater percentages of squamous cell carcinoma than women (26.0% and 17.3%, respectively), 
whereas women had greater percentages of adenocarcinomas than men (40.7% and 33.1%, respectively). Almost half (46.5%) of 
lung and bronchial cancer cases were diagnosed at the distant stage; in addition, almost half were of unknown grade 
(43.4%), followed by poorly differentiated grade (28.7%). Among men in 2004, lung and bronchial cancer incidence rates were 
highest in the South region of the United States (97.9) and lowest in the West (66.0) (<a href = "ss5708a1.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Among women, rates were similar 
in the South, Midwest, and Northeast regions (55.3--56.4) and were lowest in the West (48.1) (<a href = "ss5708a1.htm#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Arkansas, 
Delaware, Kentucky, Maine, Oklahoma, and West Virginia had some of the highest rates of lung and bronchial cancer among both 
men (98.9--133.2) and women (59.8--75.5) (<a href="ss5708a1.htm#fig1">Figures 1</a> and 
		<a href="ss5708a1.htm#fig2">2</a>).

</P><P>A total of 67,618 cases (4.3 per 100,000 persons) of laryngeal cancer were diagnosed in the United States during 
1999--2004 (<a href = "ss5708a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). Incidence rates were substantially higher among men (7.6) compared with women (1.6). Among persons 
aged &lt;80 years, rates increased with increasing age and peaked among those aged 70--79 years (19.3). Blacks had the highest 
rates (6.3 per 100,000 persons), followed by whites (4.1), AI/ANs (2.2), and A/PIs (1.5). Rates were higher among 
non-Hispanics than Hispanics (4.3 and 3.4, respectively). Among those with known tumor characteristics, almost all (96.5%) 
laryngeal cancer cases were squamous cell carcinomas. The majority (57.2%) were diagnosed at a localized stage; however, a 
smaller percentage of localized cases occurred among women (51.5%) than men (58.7%). Women had greater percentages of 
regional stage laryngeal cancer diagnoses than men (32.4% and 24.3%, respectively), whereas men had slightly greater percentages 
of distant stage diagnoses than women (9.8% for men and 8.1% for women). Almost half (46.3%) of laryngeal cancer cases 
were moderately differentiated at diagnosis. Among men in 2004, laryngeal cancer incidence rates were highest in the South 
(8.4) region of the United States and lowest in the West (4.8) (<a href = "ss5708a1.htm#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Among women, rates were similar in the South, 
Midwest, and Northeast regions (1.6--1.7) and were lowest in the West (1.1) 
(<a href = "ss5708a1.htm#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, and

(10.6), and AI/AN (9.5) men. Among women, whites had the highest rates (6.1), followed by black (5.6), A/PI (5.3), and 
AI/AN women (3.7). Rates were higher among non-Hispanics 
than Hispanics (11.0 and 7.2, respectively). The highest rates of 
OCP cancer in men occurred in the oral cavity (7.1) and tonsils (2.4) and in women occurred in the oral cavity (3.3) and 
salivary glands (0.9). Among those with known tumor characteristics, the majority of OCP cancers were squamous cell 
carcinomas (83.7%). Most were diagnosed at the localized (36.5%) or regional (46.6%) stage. However, a greater percentage of cases 
were diagnosed at the localized stage among women (43.7%) than men (33.2%), and a greater percentage of cases diagnosed at 
the regional stage occurred among men (49.7%) compared with women (39.7%). The majority of OCP cancers were 
moderately (36.0%) or poorly (23.8%) differentiated at diagnosis. In 2004, rates of OCP cancer were similar by region among men 
(14.7--16.9) and women (5.7--6.0) (<a href="ss5708a1.htm#fig5">Figures 5</a> and

one third (36.9%) were squamous cell carcinomas. A similar pattern existed among men (62.8% 
adenocarcinomas, 31.2% squamous cell carcinomas). However, the pattern differed among women, who had greater percentages of squamous 
cell carcinomas (55.8%), followed by adenocarcinomas (36.7%). Stage at diagnosis was fairly evenly distributed among 
localized (23.0%), regional (29.7%), and distant (28.6%) disease. Men had slightly smaller percentages of 
localized disease (22.3%) than women (25.4%) and slightly greater percentages of distant disease (30.3%) than women (22.9%). A

<B>Interpretation of Tobacco-Related Cancer Incidence</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Approximately 2.4 million cases of tobacco-related cancer were diagnosed in the United States during 1999--2004, 
with lung and bronchial cancer accounting for almost half of these diagnoses. The incidence of tobacco-related cancers was 
higher among men compared with women. Black and non-Hispanic populations had consistently higher incidence rates than 
other racial and ethnic populations, with a few exceptions. The majority of tobacco-related cancers occurred among persons 
aged <U>&gt;</U>70 years. The high rates among men, blacks, 
non-Hispanics, and older adults reflect overall demographic patterns of 
cancer incidence in the United States (<I>27</I>) and also reflect patterns of tobacco use. In 2006, an estimated 20.8% of all adults in 
the United States (45.3 million persons) smoked cigarettes, with smoking being more common among men (23.9%) 
compared with women (18.0%) (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5644a2.htm">23</a></I>). The prevalence of cigarette smoking varies among racial and ethnic 
minority groups; the highest prevalence is among AI/ANs (32.4%), followed by blacks (23.0%), whites (21.9%), Hispanics (15.2%), and A/PIs 
(10.4%) (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5644a2.htm">23</a></I>). Although AI/ANs did not have the highest tobacco-related cancer incidence rates overall, incidence rates for 
this population are known to be substantially underestimated in registry data because of misclassification of race in medical 
records (<I>29</I>). The relatively lower cancer incidence rates among AI/ANs in this report might be a reflection of this 
misclassification. Blacks had the highest tobacco-related cancer incidence rates in this report and have the second-highest smoking 
prevalence among racial and ethnic populations. Some reports suggest that in addition to high smoking rates, blacks might have 
increased susceptibility to the carcinogens in tobacco smoke or might have increased exposure to carcinogens through increased 
depth and frequency of inhalation (<I>33</I>).
</P><P>The incidence rates in this report generally are higher than those reported using SEER data alone from 2000--2004 
(which cover 26% of the U.S. population) 
(<I>34</I>), with the exception of stomach cancer. The higher rate of stomach cancer reflected 
by SEER data might be a result of higher proportions of 
A/PIs represented in the SEER program compared with in the 
United States, which might result in higher incidence rates for cancers that affect A/PIs 
(<I>35</I>). The higher incidence rates for 
cancers other than stomach cancer in the combined NPCR and SEER data set compared with SEER data alone are likely a result 
of the inclusion of data from additional states in the combined data set, especially states with a higher prevalence of tobacco 
use. Substantial variation in smoking prevalence exists by state among adults in the United States. The states with the 
highest prevalence of current smokers are located in the South: Kentucky (28.6%), West Virginia (25.7%), Oklahoma (25.1%), 
and Mississippi (25.1%) (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5638a2.htm">36</a></I>). Lung, laryngeal, and cervical cancer incidence rates were highest in the South; Kentucky had 
the highest rates of lung and laryngeal cancers among both men and women. States with the lowest smoking rates were in 
the West: Utah (10.4%), California, (18.5%), and Montana (18.5%) 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5638a2.htm">36</a></I>). Cancer incidence rates were consistently lowest in 
the West for all the cancers in this report, with the exception of stomach cancer.
</P><P>Cancers of the lung and bronchus, larynx, and OCP have the greatest average relative risks associated with tobacco use 
(<I>37</I>) (<a href = "ss5708a1.htm#tab12">Table 12</a>). Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men (after prostate cancer) and women 
(after breast cancer) and is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the United States 
(<I>27</I>). The average tobacco-related lung cancer relative risk is 15.0--30.0 
(<I>37</I>). Tobacco use causes all histologic types of lung cancer; 
however, differences in smoking patterns and exposures to other lung carcinogens result in variations in incidence by histologic 
type (<I>38</I>). Consistent with previous studies, the 
results of this study demonstrate that squamous cell carcinoma rates are 
higher among men, whereas adenocarcinoma rates are higher among women 
(<I>38</I>). Adenocarcinoma rates increased in the 1980s 
and 1990s (<I>39</I>), and adenocarcinoma is now the most common type of lung cancer among smokers 
(<I>17,20</I>). Certain data suggest that changes in the cigarette composition, carcinogen levels in cigarette smoke, and smoking behaviors are responsible for 
the changing histologic characteristics of lung cancer among smokers 
(<I>40</I>); however, the direct relationship of these factors to 
these changes has not been established 
(<I>17,20</I>). The introduction of filters and the modification of cigarette design and 
composition to reduce the machine-tested level of tar and nicotine has resulted in smokers inhaling more frequently and deeply and 
other compensatory smoking behaviors to sustain nicotine intake 
(<I>40</I>). As a result, cigarette smoke comes into direct contact 
with more of the lung periphery (i.e., the site where adenocarcinoma develops) than with the central lung and bronchus (i.e., 
the 

site where squamous cell carcinoma develops) 
(<I>17,20,40</I>). In addition, changes in cigarette design, composition, and 
tobacco blends have been associated with changes in the level of carcinogens consistent with the changes in the incidence of 
histologic types (i.e., reductions in polynuclear aromatic 
hydrocarbons and increases in tobacco-specific nitrosamine levels) 
(<I>17,20,40</I>). The significant decrease in lung cancer rates that occurred among men but not among women in this study is consistent 
with other studies (<I>38</I>) and is related to historical patterns of smoking prevalence. Smoking prevalence continued to increase 
among women as it was decreasing among men, leading to diverging patterns of lung cancer incidence between men and women 
(<I>41</I>).
</P><P>Laryngeal cancer is relatively rare in the United States 
(<I>27</I>). The tobacco-related relative risk for laryngeal cancer is 
10.0 (<I>37</I>). A recent case-control study confirms that tobacco use is the most substantial risk factor for laryngeal cancer 
(<I>42</I>). In addition to tobacco use, alcohol use has an important etiologic role in the formation of laryngeal cancer, and these two 
factors have a synergistic effect on laryngeal cancer risk 
(<I>42</I>). Diets low in vegetable consumption also might increase the risk 
for laryngeal cancer among women smokers 
(<I>42</I>). In this study, the high incidence rates of both lung and laryngeal 
cancer in the South are consistent with smoking patterns and reflect the strong association of these cancers with tobacco use.
</P><P>OCP cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the United States among men but is less common among women 
(<I>27</I>). This type of cancer includes tumors with origins in several anatomic organs of the head and neck. Strong evidence 
associates tobacco as the carcinogenic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck 
(<I>43</I>), which the findings from this study indicate is the predominant histologic type of OCP cancers in the United States. Smokeless tobacco use also is 
strongly associated with OCP cancer (<I>44</I>), and the average relative risk for tobacco-related OCP cancer is 4.0--5.0 
(<I>37</I>). Alcohol is a strong risk factor for OCP cancer as well, and studies have shown that the use of both tobacco and alcohol has a 
synergistic effect on the development of OCP cancer, together 
accounting for 80%--90% of all cases of OCP cancers 
(<I>43,45</I>). Among women, OCP cancers were highest among whites, a finding that might partly be related to the higher prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use among white men and women 
(<I>44</I>).
</P><P>Cancers of the pancreas and urinary bladder have similar relative risks associated with tobacco use (pancreas, 2.0--4.0; 
urinary bladder, 3.0) (<I>37</I>). Pancreatic cancer is among the top 10 cancers diagnosed and is the fourth leading cause of cancer death 
among men and women in the United States 
(<I>27</I>). Although little is known about the etiology of pancreatic cancer, smoking is 
the strongest environmental risk factor that has been identified for this cancer 
(<I>46</I>). Studies also have linked smokeless tobacco 
use to pancreatic cancer, with N-nitrosamines in these products being the plausible carcinogenic agents 
(<I>47,48</I>). Nearly all studies have shown that persons who use tobacco products have at least a twofold increased risk of developing pancreatic 
cancer compared with nonusers (<I>46,47</I>). Obesity, inflammation from pancreatitis, and several genetic syndromes also are 
associated with increased risk for pancreatic cancer 
(<I>46</I>). The incidence of pancreatic cancer found in this study remained stable 
during the study period. This finding is in contrast to findings from a recent study covering 10% of the U.S. population, 
which found significant decreases in pancreatic cancer during 1973--2002 
(<I>49</I>). The difference in trends between these two 
studies likely is a result of substantial differences in population coverage and differences in the time period studied. Certain 
studies have suggested that improvements in diagnostic modalities during the last 20 years have greatly improved the accuracy 
of pancreatic cancer diagnoses (<I>46</I>). These improvements could be related to the stability in incidence rates observed in 
this study.
</P><P>Urinary bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the United States 
(<I>27</I>). Among women, this cancer is far less common, ranking tenth among white women and lower among women of other races 
(<I>27</I>). The decrease in bladder cancer incidence rates reported in this study among men and women is consistent with findings from 
other studies. Longer-term trend analyses using SEER data alone suggest that this decrease began recently for men but has 
been occurring for several decades among women 
(<I>29</I>). Among persons who smoke, the risk of developing bladder cancer 
increases with lifetime duration of smoking and number of cigarettes smoked per day and decreases among former smokers 
(<I>50,51</I>). Results of a case-control study in Europe suggest that after cessation of smoking, the risk of bladder cancer decreases 
by approximately 40% within 1--4 years (<I>50</I>).
</P><P>AML and esophageal, kidney, stomach, and cervical cancers have similar relative risks associated with tobacco use 
(1.5--2.5) (<I>37</I>). Esophageal cancer is not as commonly diagnosed in the United States as certain other cancers discussed in this 
report; however, esophageal cancer is one of the top 10 leading causes of cancer death among most racial and ethnic populations 
(<I>27</I>). Smoking is more strongly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus than adenocarcinoma of the 
esophagus (<I>52</I>). Several studies have indicated that smokers have a twofold to threefold increase in risk for developing 
esophageal adenocarcinoma; however, esophageal adenocarcinoma risk remains elevated after cessation of 
tobacco use, and this risk might 

persist for 30 years (<I>53</I>). The relatively greater percentages of adenocarcinoma among men in this study might be related 
to this persistently elevated risk, and decreases in the incidence of this histologic type might take longer to be observed. The 
lack of a decrease in esophageal cancer incidence might also be related to this persistently elevated risk but could be related 
to trends in alcohol use and obesity, which are also established risk factors 
(<I>52</I>).
</P><P>Kidney cancer is a frequently diagnosed cancer among both men and women in the United States 
(<I>27</I>). Risk factors for kidney cancer are not well understood. For both men and women, kidney cancer risk was found to increase with duration 
of lifetime smoking and number of cigarettes smoked per day and to decrease among former smokers 
(<I>54</I>). In addition to smoking, obesity and hypertension are emerging as risk factors for kidney cancer 
(<I>55</I>). For both men and women, kidney cancer rates increased during the study period. These findings are similar to those from a study of long-term SEER data, 
which found that this increase has been evident for both men and women during the past several decades 
(<I>29</I>) and might be a result of the prevalence of obesity 
(<I>56</I>). Certain studies also suggest that the increase in kidney cancer rates might be a result 
of increased detection of kidney cancer through the increased use of ultrasound and computed 
tomography for non--cancer-related conditions 
(<I>57</I>).
</P><P>Stomach cancer is common among certain racial and ethnic populations in the United States 
(<I>27</I>). Tobacco use is related to both cardia and noncardia stomach cancer; the 
association with noncardia adenocarcinoma is stronger 
(<I>58</I>). Risk is related to number of cigarettes smoked per day and lifetime duration of smoking, and the risk decreases by 
approximately 30% among former smokers (<I>59</I>). In addition to tobacco use, the major risk factors for stomach cancer 
include a diet of salted foods and smoked meat and chronic infection with 
<I>Helicobacter pylori</I> (<I>60</I>), which was determined to be a carcinogen by IARC in 
1994 (<I>61</I>). <I>H. pylori</I> plays a much larger role in stomach cancer etiology in areas of the world where the prevalence of infection 
is higher, especially in Asian countries, which have 70% of cases of stomach cancer worldwide 
(<I>60</I>). Several studies have reported that racial and ethnic populations other than whites have higher prevalences of 
<I>H. pylori</I> infection (<I>62,63</I>). These findings 
are consistent with the results of this study, which found higher stomach cancer incidence rates in these populations. Persons 
who smoke are more likely to develop persistent infections with 
<I>H. pylori</I> and less likely to respond to antibiotic treatment for 
the infection (<I>64</I>). The finding in this study that stomach cancer incidence has been decreasing in recent years is consistent 
with findings of other studies that have demonstrated decreases during the last several decades 
(<I>29</I>) and might be a result of increases in consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, 
decreases in the consumption of salt-preserved food, and 
decreases in the prevalence of <I>H. pylori</I> infection.
</P><P>Although the overall incidence of cervical cancer is low in the United States, black and Hispanic women continue to have 
a higher incidence of this cancer than white women 
(<I>27</I>). Smoking consistently has been associated with higher risks of 
cervical cancer, and this risk increases with the lifetime duration of smoking and number of cigarettes smoked per day 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5112a4.htm">65</a></I>). Carcinogenic chemicals consistent with tobacco use have been found in cervical mucous 
(<I>66</I>), as have changes in DNA (i.e., formation of adducts) 
(<I>67</I>). Although tobacco use is related to cervical cancer, the primary risk factor is human 
papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is a sexually transmitted disease. HPV infection likely accounts for the lower peak age (40--49 
years) of incidence of cervical cancer in this report, as well as the high rate among Hispanic women 
(<I>68</I>). Smoking and HPV might also act synergistically in the occurrence of cervical cancer. Recent studies show consistently that smoking is associated with 
an increased risk for developing cervical cancer among HPV-positive women 
(<I>69</I>). The increased risk is moderate (odds ratio 
= 2.17; CI = 1.46--3.22) and is not likely to be a result of confounding by varying sexual behaviors 
(<I>59</I>), because all women were HPV-positive in these analyses. The decrease in cervical cancer rates is likely a result of continued screening, 
which identifies premalignant lesions that are removed before a malignancy occurs 
(<I>29</I>).
</P><P>AML is a relatively rare cancer in the United States 
(<I>27</I>). Current cigarette smoking is an established risk factor for AML; 
in populations with a high prevalence of smoking, 20% of AML cancers are attributable to tobacco use among current 
smokers (<I>70</I>). Smoking is thought to increase risk through exposure to benzene, an environmental agent consistently 
associated with AML, and other carcinogens found in tobacco. AML incidence was highest among white men and women, and Vermont 
had the highest incidence rate among men in 2004, findings that are inconsistent with smoking patterns. This lends support to 
the multiple factors involved in AML etiology, which is related to race and ethnicity, environmental exposures, and genetic 
risk factors that have not yet been determined. Several recent reports have implicated obesity as an emerging risk factor for 
AML (<I>71</I>).
</P><P>The detailed cancer incidence data in this report provide a baseline measurement that can be used in future monitoring 
of cancer incidence trends. As more geographically complete incidence data become available for all populations in the 
United 

States, researchers might be able to further describe patterns of cancer incidence that are specifically related to 
tobacco use, similar to studies of mortality disparities 
(<I>72</I>). This will ensure that any reductions in the incidence of 
tobacco-related cancers are maintained and disparities in 
incidence are identified.
<H4>
<B>Limitations</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, information about smoking status and other 
risk factors for cancer (e.g., obesity or HPV) is not available in cancer registry data. Therefore, although the overall incidence 
of tobacco-related cancers in the United States is presented, the association between the development of these cancers 
and tobacco and other etiologic could not be determined. Second, data for AI/ANs have been shown to be 
considerably underreported in cancer registries 
(<I>73</I>). Linkage with external sources of information such as IHS administration 
records improved the quality of AI/AN data in this study 
(<I>29</I>); however, because IHS only serves federally recognized tribes, these 
data might not fully represent all AI/ANs, especially those in state-recognized tribes. Finally, although this study covered &gt;90% 
of the U.S. population and is the most inclusive study of the U.S. population, high-quality incidence data were not 
available from Maryland, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Virginia for the study period.
<H4>
<B>Public Health Action</B>
</H4>
</P><P>In 2007, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) presented a blueprint for action to &quot;reduce smoking so substantially that it is 
no longer a public health problem for our nation&quot; 
(<I>74</I>). The two-pronged strategy for achieving this goal included not 
only strengthening and fully implementing proven tobacco control measures but also changing the regulatory landscape to 
permit policy innovations. The primary IOM recommendation is that each state should fund a comprehensive tobacco 
control program at the level recommended by CDC 
(<I>74,75</I>).
</P><P>CDC recommends that states establish and sustain tobacco control programs that contain the following components: 
state and community interventions, health communication interventions, cessation interventions, surveillance and evaluation, 
and administration and management (<I>75</I>). <I>Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs --- 
2007</I> is an evidence-based guide designed to help states plan and establish effective tobacco control programs to prevent and reduce 
tobacco use (<I>75</I>). Each state is provided a recommendation for the annual investment necessary to prevent initiation of tobacco use, 
promote cessation among those already using tobacco, eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke, and eliminate 
tobacco-use--related disparities, such as differences in patterns of use, cessation, morbidity, exposure, and access to resources 
(<I>75</I>).<B> </B>Additional support for tobacco control comes from CDC's National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program, which provides 
financial support and advice to aid states in developing and implementing cancer control plans. Comprehensive cancer control is 
based on the premise that effective cancer control planning and program implementation at the local, state, and national 
levels address a continuum of services, including primary prevention and early detection, quality cancer treatment, and 
addressing the needs of cancer survivors 
(<I>76</I>). A recent assessment concluded that nearly one half of 39 published plans addressed 
tobacco control; however, plans varied widely and can be improved 
(<I>76</I>).
</P><P>States that have made tobacco control a priority have benefited from this commitment. For example, California, which 
has the longest-running comprehensive tobacco control program in the United States, reduced adult smoking prevalence 
from 22.7% in 1998 to 13.3% in 2006 (<I>77</I>). The incidence of lung cancer has decreased nearly four times more quickly 
in California than in the rest of the United States, which likely is partly a result of program-related reductions in 
smoking (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4947a4.htm">78</a>,79</I>), and during 1987--1997, an estimated 11,000 cases of lung cancer were prevented 
(<I>80</I>). Additional states such as Florida 
(<I>81</I>), Maine, New York, and Washington 
(<I>82--84</I>) also have been successful in reducing smoking among adults 
and youths. Cancer incidence in these and other states should 
continue to be monitored at the local, state, and national 
levels to measure the impact of these public health successes in reducing the effects of tobacco use.
</P><P>Ongoing cancer incidence reporting is essential to help identify types of cancers, in addition to those reported in this 
study, that might also be causally related to tobacco use. In 2004, the Surgeon General concluded that evidence was suggestive 
but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship between smoking and colorectal adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer 
(<I>17</I>). Several more recently published studies have provided additional data implying a potential causal relationship 
(<I>85--87</I>); however, the relationship might be stronger for rectal than colon cancer 
(<I>86</I>). Current and former smoking should be 

considered a potential risk factor for colorectal cancer in clinical and public health settings, and future research should 
focus on evaluating the association between smoking and colorectal cancer risk.
</P><P>The Surgeon General also concluded that the evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal 
relationship between smoking and liver cancer 
(<I>17</I>); however, IARC review concluded that the data were sufficient to infer a 
causal relationship (<I>20</I>). Although substantial epidemiologic evidence suggests a relationship between smoking and liver cancer, 
the 2004 Surgeon General report review determined that important questions remain regarding the impact of hepatitis 
infection and alcohol use on the relationship between smoking and liver cancer 
(<I>17</I>). The strength of an association between 
cigarette smoking and liver cancer varies according to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status, with stronger associations 
among persons who are not infected with HBV. Additional research is needed to establish the possible association between 
smoking and liver cancer, with further consideration of the history of hepatitis infection and other confounding factors such as 
alcohol use.
</P><P>Breast cancer risk related to tobacco smoke exposure also has been recognized 
(<I>17,89,90</I>). However, the 2006 Surgeon General report 
<I>The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco 
Smoke</I> concludes that the evidence is suggestive 
but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship between secondhand smoke and breast cancer 
(<I>88</I>). The 2004 IARC publication <I>Tobacco Smoke and Involuntary 
Smoking</I> concluded that active smoking is not associated with an increased risk for 
breast cancer in studies that compare active smokers with persons who have never smoked 
(<I>20</I>). However, the lack of evidence for an increase in breast cancer risk among active, female smokers does not exclude the possibility that certain subgroups of 
female smokers might be at increased risk because of genetic or other factors.
</P><P>Additional research and evaluation of data are needed to help determine whether a causal relationship exists 
between smoking and certain cancers such as colorectal, liver, and breast cancer. If the evidence indicates that these cancers, 
and perhaps other types, are associated with smoking, the incidence of cancer attributed to smoking in the United States might 
rise substantially. Ongoing surveillance and reporting are 
essential to monitor cancer incidence trends, identify populations 
at greatest risk for developing tobacco-related cancers, and evaluate the effectiveness of targeted tobacco control 
programs and policies.
