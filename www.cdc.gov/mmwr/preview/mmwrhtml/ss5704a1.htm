</h3><P><b>Problem:</b> Priority health-risk behaviors, which are behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of 
morbidity and mortality among youth and adults, often are established during childhood and adolescence, extend 
into adulthood, are interrelated, and are preventable. 
</P><P><b>Reporting Period Covered:</b> January--December 2007. 
</P><P><b>Description of the System:</b> The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories 
of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults, including behaviors that contribute 
to unintentional injuries and violence; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that 
contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection; unhealthy dietary behaviors; and physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors 
the prevalence of obesity and asthma. YRBSS includes a national school-based survey conducted by CDC and 
state and local school-based surveys conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This 
report summarizes results from the national survey, 39 state surveys, and 22 local surveys conducted among 
students in grades 9--12 during 2007. 
</P><P><b>Results: </b>In the United States, 72% of all deaths among persons aged 10--24 years result from four 
causes: motor-vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 2007 
national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) indicated that many high school students engaged in behaviors 
that increased their likelihood of death from these four causes. Among high school students nationwide 
during 2007, 11.1% had never or rarely worn a seat belt when riding in a car driven by someone else. During the 
30 days before the survey, 29.1% of high school students had ridden in a car or other vehicle driven by 
someone who had been drinking alcohol, 18.0% had carried a weapon, and 5.5% had not gone to school because 
they felt they would be unsafe at school or on their way to or from school. During the 12 months before the 
survey, 6.9% of high school students had attempted suicide. In addition, 75.0% of high school students had 
ever drunk alcohol, and 4.4% had ever used methamphetamines. Substantial morbidity and social problems 
among youth also result from unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection. Results from the 
2007 survey indicated that 47.8% of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 35.0% of high school students 
were currently sexually active, and 38.5% of currently sexually active high school students had not used a 
condom during last sexual intercourse. Among U.S. adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>25 years, 59% of all deaths result from 
two<B> </B>causes: cardiovascular disease and cancer. Results from the 2007 national YRBS indicated that risk 
behaviors associated with these two causes of death were present during adolescence. Among high school 
students nationwide during 2007, 20.0% had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days before the survey, 35.4% 
had watched television 3 or more hours per day on an average school day, and 13.0% were obese. During the 
7 days before the survey, 78.6% of high school students had not eaten fruits and vegetables five or more 
times per day, 33.8% had drunk soda or pop at least one time per day, and 65.3% had not met recommended 
levels of physical activity. 
</P><P><b>Interpretation:</b> Since 1991, the prevalence of many health-risk behaviors among high school 
students nationwide has decreased. However, many high school students continue to engage in behaviors that 
place 

them at risk for the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. The prevalence of most risk behaviors does 
not vary substantially among cities and states. 
</P><P><b>Public Health Action:</b> YRBS data are used to measure progress toward achieving 15 national health 
objectives for <I>Healthy People 2010</I> and three of the 10 leading health indicators, to assess trends in priority 
health-risk behaviors among high school students, and to evaluate the impact of broad school and 
community interventions at the national, state, and local levels. More effective school health programs and other policy 
and programmatic interventions are needed to reduce risk and improve health 
outcomes among youth.

		</h3>
</H3>
		<P>In the United States, 72% of all deaths among youth and young adults aged 10--24 years result from four 
causes: motor-vehicle crashes (30%), other unintentional injuries (15%), homicide (15%), and suicide (12%) 
(<I>1</I>). Substantial morbidity and social problems also result from the 
approximately 757,000 pregnancies among women aged 
15--19 years (<I>2</I>), the estimated 9.1 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among persons aged 15--24 years 
(<I>3</I>), and the estimated 5,089 cases of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(HIV/AIDS) among persons aged 15--24 years 
(<I>4</I>) that occur annually. Among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>25 years, 59% of all deaths in the United States result from cardiovascular disease (36%) and cancer (23%) 
(<I>1</I>). These leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults in the United States are related to six categories of priority health-risk 
behaviors: behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; 
sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and STDs, including HIV infection; unhealthy dietary 
behaviors; and physical inactivity. These behaviors frequently are interrelated and are established during childhood and 
adolescence and extend into adulthood. 
</P><P>To monitor priority health-risk behaviors in each of these six categories and obesity and asthma among youth 
and young adults, CDC developed the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5312a1.htm">5</a></I>). YRBSS includes national, state, and local school-based surveys of students in grades 9--12. National, state, and local surveys have 
been conducted biennially since 1991 (<a href = "ss5704a1.htm#box">Box</a>). 
</P><P>This report summarizes results from the 2007 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and trends during 
1991--2007 in selected risk behaviors. Data from the 39 state and 
22<B> </B>local surveys with weighted data for the 2007 
YRBSS cycle also are included (<a href = "ss5704a1.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>) in this report. Data from the remaining five state surveys with unweighted data are 
not included. The national survey, 37<B> </B>weighted state surveys, 
and<B> </B>22 weighted local surveys were conducted during 
spring 2007, and two of the weighted state surveys were conducted during fall 
2007<B>.</B>

</P><P>Detailed information about the local, state, and national YRBSs has been described elsewhere 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5312a1.htm">5</a></I>). Information  also is available at 
		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs">http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs</a>.
<H4>
<B>Sampling</B>
</H4>
</P><P>
<B>National Youth Risk Behavior Survey </B>
</P><P>The sampling frame for the 2007 national YRBS consisted of all public and private schools with students in at 
least one of grades 9--12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The sampling frame was obtained from the 
Quality Education Data (QED), Inc., database 
(<I>6</I>). The QED database includes information on both public and private 
schools and the most recent data from the Common Core of Data from the National Center for Education Statistics 
(<I>7</I>). A three-stage cluster sample design produced a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9--12 who 
attend public and private schools. The first-stage sampling frame consisted of 1,268 primary sampling units (PSUs), 
consisting of counties, subareas of large counties, or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. 
The<B> </B>1,268<B> </B>PSUs were categorized into 
16 strata according to their metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status (i.e., urbanicity) and the percentages of 
black* and 

Hispanic<SUP>&#134;</SUP> students in the PSUs. From the 1,268 PSUs, 57 were selected with probability proportional to overall 
school enrollment size for the PSU. 
</P><P>In the second stage of sampling, 195 schools with any of grades 9--12 were selected with probability proportional 
to school enrollment size. The third stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting, in each chosen school and in each 
of grades 9--12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject (e.g., English or social studies) or a 
required period (e.g., homeroom or second period). All students in selected classes were eligible to participate. Schools, classes, 
and students that refused to participate were not replaced. 
</P><P>To enable a separate analysis of data for black and Hispanic students, three strategies were used to oversample 
these students: 1) larger sampling rates were used to select PSUs that are in high-black and high-Hispanic strata; 2) 
a modified measure of size was used that increased the probability of selecting schools with a disproportionately 
high minority enrollment; and 3) two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in schools with a high 
minority enrollment. 
</P><P>
<B>State and Local Youth Risk Behavior Surveys </B>
</P><P>In 2007, each state and local school-based survey 
used a two-stage cluster sample design to produce a 
representative sample of public school students in grades 9--12 in their jurisdiction. In the first sampling stage, schools with any 
of grades 9--12 were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size in 37 states and five cities; all 
schools with any of grades 9--12 were selected in two states and 17 cities. In the second sampling stage, intact classes 
from either a required subject (e.g., English or social 
studies) or a required period (e.g., homeroom or second period) 
were selected randomly, and all students in selected classes were eligible to participate in 38 states and 22 cities; all 
students in selected schools were eligible to participate in one state. 
<H4>
<B>Data Collection Procedures and Questionnaires </B>
</H4>
</P><P>Survey procedures for the national, state, and local surveys were designed to protect students' privacy by allowing 
for anonymous and voluntary participation. Before survey administration, local parental permission procedures 
were followed. Students completed the self-administered questionnaire during one class period and recorded their 
responses directly on a computer-scannable booklet or 
answer sheet. CDC's Institutional Review Board approved the protocol 
for the national YRBS. 
</P><P>The core questionnaire contained 87 questions. States and cities could add or delete questions from the 
core questionnaire. For the national questionnaire, 11 questions were added to the core questionnaire. Skip patterns were 
not included in any YRBS questionnaire to protect students' privacy by ensuring all students took about the same amount 
of time to complete the survey. For state and local surveys, only data from core questions are presented in this 
report. Information about the reliability of the core questionnaire has been published elsewhere 
(<I>8</I>). 
<H4>
<B>Data Processing Procedures and Response Rates</B>
</H4>
</P><P>For the 2007 national YRBS, 14,103 questionnaires were completed in 
157<B> </B>schools. The national data set was 
cleaned and edited for inconsistencies. Missing data were not statistically imputed. Of the 14,103 completed 
questionnaires from the national YRBS, 62 failed quality 
control<SUP>&#167;</SUP> and were excluded from analysis, leaving 
14,041<B> </B>usable questionnaires (<a href = "ss5704a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). The school response rate was 81%; the student response rate was 84%; the overall response 
rate was 68%<SUP>&#182;</SUP> (<a href = "ss5704a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). 
</P><P>In 2007, a total of 39 state and 22 local surveys had weighted data. Data from each state and local data set 
were cleaned and edited for inconsistencies with the same procedures used for the national data set. The number of 
completed questionnaires that failed quality control checks and were excluded from analysis from the state and local surveys 
ranged from 0 to 117 (median: six). The student sample sizes ranged from 1,118 to 13,439 (<a href = "ss5704a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). School 
response rates ranged from 69% to 100%; student response rates ranged from 60% to 92%; and overall response rates ranged 
from 60% to 90%.<B> </B>
</P><P>Race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 1) &quot;Are you Hispanic or Latino?&quot; (response options were &quot;yes&quot; 
or &quot;no&quot;), and 2) &quot;What is your race?&quot; (response options were &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; &quot;black 
or 

African American,&quot; &quot;Native Hawaiian or other Pacific 
Islander,&quot; or &quot;white&quot;). For the second question, students 
could select more than one response option. For this 
report, students were classified as &quot;Hispanic/Latino&quot; if they 
answered &quot;yes&quot; to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students were classified as &quot;black&quot; if 
they answered &quot;no&quot; to the first question and 
selected only &quot;black or African American&quot; to the second question. Students 
were classified as &quot;white&quot; if they answered &quot;no&quot; to the first question and selected only &quot;white&quot; to the second 
question. Students were classified as &quot;other&quot; if they answered &quot;no&quot; to the first question and selected &quot;American Indian or 
Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; and/or &quot;Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander&quot; or selected more than one 
response to the second question. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did not answer the first question and for 
students who answered &quot;no&quot; to the first question but did not answer the second question. Throughout this report, students 
who self-identified as &quot;Hispanic/Latino&quot; are referred to as &quot;Hispanic&quot; and students who self-identified as &quot;black or 
African American&quot; are referred to as &quot;black.&quot;
</P><P>Students were classified as obese or overweight based on their body mass index 
(kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>) (BMI), which was calculated from self-reported height and weight. The BMI values were compared with sex- and age-specific reference data from 
the 2000 CDC growth charts (<I>9</I>). Obese was defined as a BMI of 
<U>&gt;</U>95th percentile for age and sex. Overweight was 
defined as a BMI of <U>&gt;</U>85th percentile and &lt;95th percentile for age and sex. Previous YRBS reports used the terms 
&quot;overweight&quot; to describe youth with a BMI 
<U>&gt;</U>95th percentile for age and sex and &quot;at risk for overweight&quot; for those with a BMI 
<U>&gt;</U>85th percentile and &lt;95th percentile. However, this report uses the terms &quot;obese&quot; and &quot;overweight&quot; in accordance with 
the 2007 recommendations from the Expert Committee on the Assessment, Prevention, and Treatment of Child 
and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity convened by the American Medical Association (AMA) and cofunded by AMA 
in collaboration with the Health Resources and Services Administration and CDC 
(<I>10</I>). These classifications are not intended to diagnose obesity or overweight in individual students, rather to provide 
estimates of obesity and overweight for the population of students surveyed. 
<H4>
<B>Weighting</B>
</H4>
</P><P>For the national YRBS, a weight based on student sex, race/ethnicity, and grade was applied to each record 
to adjust for school and student nonresponse and oversampling of black and Hispanic students. The overall weights 
were scaled so that the weighted count of students equals the total sample size, and the weighted proportions of students 
in each grade match the national population proportions. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students 
in grades 9--12 attending public and private school in the United States.
</P><P>State and local surveys that had a representative sample of students, appropriate documentation, and an 
overall response rate of 60% or higher were weighted. A weight was applied to each record to adjust for student 
nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted state 
and local estimates are representative of all students 
in grades 9--12 attending public schools in each jurisdiction. 
<H4>
<B>Analytic Methods </B>
</H4>
</P><P>Statistical analyses were conducted on weighted data 
using SAS<SUP>&#174;</SUP> (<I>11</I>) and SUDAAN 
(<I>12</I>) software to account for the complex sampling designs. Prevalence estimates and confidence intervals were computed for all variables and all 
data sets. In addition, for the national YRBS data, t tests were used to determine pairwise differences between 
subpopulations and temporal changes during 2005--2007 
(<I>13</I>). Differences between prevalence estimates were considered 
statistically significant if the t test p value was &lt;0.05 for main effects (sex, race/ethnicity, and grade), for interactions (sex by 
race/ethnicity, sex by grade, race/ethnicity by sex, and grade by sex), and for changes over time. Only statistically 
significant differences in prevalence estimates are reported in the results section in the following order: sex, sex by race/ethnicity, 
sex by grade, race/ethnicity, race/ethnicity by sex, grade, and grade by sex. 
</P><P>For the national YRBS data, temporal changes from the earliest year of data collection to 2007 were analyzed 
using logistic regression analyses that controlled for sex, grade, and race/ethnicity and that simultaneously assessed linear 
and quadratic time effects (<I>13</I>). Quadratic trends indicate a significant but nonlinear trend in the data over time. Trends 
that 

include significant linear and quadratic components demonstrate nonlinear variation (e.g., leveling off or change 
in direction) in addition to an overall increase or decrease over time. Trends are described only for variables with 
significant temporal changes from the earliest year of data collection to 2007 or during 2005--2007.

<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Discussion </FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>Certain risk behaviors are more likely to occur among subpopulations of students defined by sex, race/ethnicity, 
and grade. However, this analysis could not isolate the 
effects of sex, race/ethnicity, or grade from the effects of 
socioeconomic status (SES) or culture on risk behaviors with substantial disparities. In a 1992 national study, after controlling for 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and school enrollment status (i.e., in school or out of school), adolescents aged 12--17 years were 
less likely to report selected risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity, eating too little fruit and vegetables, 
and episodic heavy drinking) as the SES (education or family income) of the responsible adult in their family increased 
(<I>15</I>). Additional research is needed to assess the effect of specific educational, socioeconomic, cultural, and racial/ethnic 
factors on the prevalence of health-risk behaviors among high school students. 
</P><P>For the majority of risk behaviors, prevalence does not vary substantially across states or across cities. However, 
across state surveys, a range of 25 or more percentage points or a fivefold variation or greater was identified for 
the following risk behaviors: 
</P><UL>
<LI>rarely or never wore a bicycle helmet (minimum: 57.6%; maximum: 94.8%); 
<LI>lifetime cigarette use (minimum: 24.9%; 
maximum: 62.2%);

<LI>bought cigarettes in a store or gas station 
(minimum: 3.0%; maximum: 27.0%);
<LI>current tobacco use (minimum: 8.9%; maximum: 34.5%);

<LI>attended PE class daily (minimum: 6.7%; 
maximum: 47.3%).

</UL>
</P><P>Across local surveys, a range of 25 or more percentage points or a fivefold variation or greater was identified for 
the following risk behaviors: 
</P><UL>
<LI>rarely or never wore a bicycle helmet (minimum: 69.7%; maximum: 96.4%); 
<LI>smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day (minimum: 1.9%; maximum: 12.8%);

(minimum: 10.2%; maximum: 39.4%);
<LI>current smokeless tobacco use (minimum: 1.0%; maximum: 7.2%);
<LI>lifetime marijuana use (minimum: 22.8%; 
maximum: 50.8%);
<LI>lifetime cocaine use (minimum: 0.9%; maximum: 12.6%); 
<LI>current cocaine use (minimum: 0.5%; maximum: 6.2%); 
<LI>lifetime illegal injection-drug use (minimum: 0.5%; maximum: 5.5%); 
<LI>lifetime heroin use (minimum: 0.6%; maximum: 5.4%); 
<LI>lifetime methamphetamine use (minimum: 0.7%; maximum: 9.0%); 
<LI>used smokeless tobacco on school property 
(minimum: 0.5%; maximum: 3.8%); 
<LI>offered, sold, or given an illegal drug on school 
property (minimum: 13.5%; maximum: 39.2%);
<LI>ever had sexual intercourse (minimum: 26.4%; maximum: 67.1%); 
<LI>currently sexually active (minimum: 17.5%; 
maximum: 49.7%); 
<LI>drank soda or pop at least one time per day 
(minimum: 14.4%; maximum: 39.9%);
<LI>watched television 3 or more hours per day 
(minimum: 33.2%; maximum: 60.5%);
<LI>attended PE class (minimum: 29.3%; maximum: 78.9%); and
<LI>attended PE class daily (minimum: 6.5%; 
maximum: 54.0%).
</UL>
</P><P>These variations might occur, in part, because of differences in state and local laws and policies, enforcement 
practices, access to illegal drugs, availability of effective school and community interventions, prevailing behavioral and 
social norms, demographic characteristics of the population, and adult practices. Longitudinal research is needed to 
better understand the effect of these factors on the 
development and prevalence of risk behaviors. 
<H4>
<B><I>Healthy People 2010 </I></B>
</H4>
</P><P>The national YRBS is the primary source of data to measure 15 
<I>Healthy People 2010</I> objectives and three 
leading health indicators (<I>16</I>). The <I>Healthy People 
2010</I> objectives provide a comprehensive agenda for improving the health 
of all persons in the United States during the first decade of the 21st century. This report provides the 2010 target 
and data from the 2007 national YRBS for all 15 objectives (<a href = "ss5704a1.htm#tab96">Table 96</a>). 
<H4>
<B>Limitations </B>
</H4>
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, these data apply only to youth 
who attend school and, therefore, are not representative of all persons in this age group. Nationwide, in 2005, of 
persons aged 16--17 years, approximately 3% were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high 
school (<I>17</I>). Second, the extent of underreporting or overreporting of behaviors cannot be determined, although the 
survey questions demonstrate good test-retest reliability 
(<I>8</I>). Third, BMI is calculated on the basis of self-reported height 
and weight, and, therefore, tends to underestimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight 
(<I>18</I>). 
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Conclusion </FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>The national YRBS data are used routinely by CDC and other federal agencies. For example, CDC uses YRBS data 
for the following:
</P><UL>
<LI>to assess trends in priority health-risk behaviors among high school students; 
<LI>to monitor progress toward achieving 15 
<I>Healthy People 2010</I> health objectives and three leading health 
indicators (<I>16</I>); 
<LI>to evaluate components of CDC's Performance Plan in compliance with the Government Performance and 
Results Act (<I>19</I>); and 

<LI>to evaluate the contribution of HIV prevention and chronic disease prevention efforts in schools toward helping 
the nation reduce health-risk behaviors among youth. 
</UL>
</P><P>State and local agencies and nongovernmental organizations use YRBS data to set school health and health 
promotion program goals, support modification of school health curricula or other programs, support new legislation and 
policies that promote health, and seek funding for new initiatives. For example, Hillsborough County, Florida, used YRBS 
data to enhance health education, physical education, and health science education programs and to create a guide for 
high school science teachers to use when discussing specific topics related to HIV, STDs, and unintended pregnancies. 
In Michigan, YRBS data are used to plan and advocate for coordinated school health programs and other 
health-related initiatives in their state. The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) developed the SFUSD Family Guide, 
which combines its YRBS data in an easy-to-read form with information on related school health programs, national 
research, and strategies for promoting health at home. The family guides are available to parents, students, and 
community organizations. In Utah, YRBS data on sedentary activities were used in developing the &quot;Unplug and Play Program&quot; 
to promote physical activity. This program was implemented for the first time in 2007. 
</P><P>Seventy six percent of all states have YRBS data representative of their high school students attending public 
schools. Continued support for and expansion of YRBSS will help monitor and ensure effectiveness of public health and 
school health programs for youth.

 Previous Youth Risk Behavior Survey reports used the term overweight to describe youth with a BMI >95th percentile for age and sex and at risk
for overweight for those with a BMI >85th percentile and <95th percentile. However, this report uses the terms obese and overweight in
accordance with the 2007 recommendations from the Expert Committee on the Assessment, Prevention, and Treatment of Child and Adolescent
Overweight and Obesity convened by the American Medical Association (AMA) and cofunded by AMA in collaboration with the Health Resources and

* Students who were >95th percentile for body mass index, by age and sex, based on reference data.
 Previous Youth Risk Behavior Survey reports used the term overweight to describe youth with a BMI >95th percentile for age and sex and at risk for overweight for those
with a BMI >85th percentile and <95th percentile. However, this report uses the terms obese and overweight in accordance with the 2007 recommendations from the Expert
Committee on the Assessment, Prevention, and Treatment of Child and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity convened by the American Medical Association (AMA) and
cofunded by AMA in collaboration with the Health Resources and Services Administration and CDC.
