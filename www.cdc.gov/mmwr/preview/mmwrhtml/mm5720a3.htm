<H1>State Smoking Restrictions for Private-Sector Worksites, Restaurants, 
and Bars --- United States, 2004 and 2007</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Secondhand smoke (SHS) contains more than 50 carcinogens and causes heart disease and lung cancer in 
nonsmoking adults (<I>1</I>). Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces is the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from SHS 
exposure (<I>1</I>). Smoking restrictions limit smoking to certain areas within a venue; smoke-free policies prohibit smoking within 
the entire venue. A <I>Healthy People 2010</I> objective (27-13) calls for establishing laws in all 50 states and the District 
of Columbia (DC) that make indoor public places and worksites completely smoke-free 
(<I>2</I>). To assess progress toward meeting this objective, CDC reviewed the status of state laws restricting smoking in effect as of December 31, 
2007, updating a 2005 study that reported on such laws as of December 31, 2004 
(<I><a href="mm5426a1.htm">3</a></I>). This report summarizes the changes in state smoking restrictions for private-sector worksites, restaurants, and bars that occurred from 2004 to 2007. 
The findings indicated a substantial increase in the number and restrictiveness of state laws regulating smoking in these 
three settings, providing nonsmokers with increased 
protection from the health risks posed by SHS. If current 
trends continue, achieving the national health objective 
by 2010 might be possible.
</P><P>This report focuses on smoking restrictions in indoor 
areas in private-sector worksites, restaurants, and bars. 
These three settings were selected because worksites are a major source of SHS exposure for nonsmokers and because workers 
in restaurants and bars are especially likely to be 
exposed to SHS, often at high concentrations 
(<I>1</I>). The smoking restrictions in effect in each of the 50 states and 
DC* as of December 31, 2004, and December 31, 2007, were categorized into 
one of four levels (<a href = "mm5720a3.htm#tab">Table</a>). The four levels were 1) no restrictions, 2) designated smoking areas 
required or allowed (i.e., smoking is restricted to specific areas), 3) no smoking allowed or designated smoking areas allowed if 
separately ventilated, and 4) no smoking allowed (i.e., 100% smoke-free). These data were compiled from CDC's State 
Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System database, which contains tobacco-related epidemiologic 
and economic data and information on state tobacco-related legislation 
(<I>4</I>). The data used for this report were 
collected quarterly from an online database of state laws, analyzed using a coding scheme and decision rules, and transferred 
into the STATE System database. The STATE System tracks state smoking restrictions in government worksites, 
private-sector worksites, restaurants, bars, commercial and home-based child care centers, and other settings, 
including shopping malls, grocery stores, enclosed arenas, public transportation, hospitals, prisons, and 
hotels and motels. Tobacco-control personnel in state health departments reviewed and verified the coding of smoking restrictions in 
their states.
</P><P>This study did not include laws that were enacted or became effective after December 31, 2007. For example, 
Illinois and Maryland enacted smoking restrictions in 2007 that went into effect in early 2008, and were therefore not 
included in this study.
</P><P>During December 31, 2004--December 31, 2007, based on the effective date of state laws (i.e., the date that 
these laws actually took effect, not the date they were enacted) and the STATE System coding scheme, the level of 
smoking restrictions became more protective for private-sector worksites in 18 states, for restaurants in 18 states, and for bars 
in 12 states. No states relaxed their smoking restrictions in any of these three settings during the study 
period. In addition, the number of states requiring private-sector worksites to be smoke-free increased from five to 22. As of December 
31, 2004, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, and South 
Dakota had banned smoking in private-sector 
worksites. As of December 31, 2007, an additional 17 states 
(Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, DC, Hawaii, Louisiana, 
Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North 
Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, and 
Washington) had done so. During the study period, the number of states with no smoking restrictions in place for 
private-sector worksites decreased from 24 to 13.
</P><P>During the 3 years ending December 31, 2007, the number of states requiring restaurants to be smoke-free 
increased from seven to 21. By the end of 2004, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, and Utah 
had banned smoking in restaurants. As of December 31, 2007, 14 additional states (Arizona, Colorado, DC, 
Hawaii, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, 
and 

Washington) had done so. During this same period, the number of states with no smoking restrictions for 
restaurants decreased from 19 to nine.
</P><P>During the same 3-year period, the number of states 
requiring bars to be smoke-free increased from four to 13. By 
the end of 2004, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, and New York had banned smoking in bars. As of December 31, 
2007, an additional nine states (Arizona, Colorado, DC, Hawaii, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, 
and Washington) had done so. During the 3 years of this study, the number of states with no smoking restrictions for 
bars decreased from 43 to 31.
</P><P>From December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2007, the number of states requiring all three venues included in 
this study to be smoke-free increased from three to 12. By the end of 2004, Delaware, Massachusetts, and New York 
had banned smoking in all three settings. As of December 31, 2007, Arizona, Colorado, DC, Hawaii, Minnesota, 
New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Washington also had implemented such comprehensive laws. During the study 
period, the number of states with smoke-free provisions in place in at least one of the three settings included in this 
study increased from eight to 25. During this same period, the number of states without any smoking restrictions in place 
for any of these settings decreased from 16 to eight.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> The findings of this analysis indicate that the number and restrictiveness of state laws 
regulating smoking in private-sector worksites, restaurants, and bars increased substantially from December 31, 2004, 
to December 31, 2007. This increase has provided U.S. nonsmokers with increased protection from SHS exposure and 
its health effects (<I>1</I>).
</P><P>As of 2003, the most recent data available, 77% of U.S. indoor workers aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years reported that their workplace had an official policy that prohibited smoking in 
indoor work areas and public or common areas 
(<I>5</I>), compared with 47% during 1992--1993 
(<I>1</I>). However, the proportion of workers covered by such policies varied by occupation. 
In 2003, for example, 83% of white collar workers reported working under a smoke-free workplace policy, compared 
with 75% of service workers, 63% of blue collar workers, and 72% of food-service workers 
(<I>5</I>). As a result of continuing gaps and disparities in policy coverage for many private-sector worksites, restaurants, and bars, millions of U.S. 
nonsmokers continue to be exposed to SHS and its health effects in these settings, either as employees or as patrons.
</P><P>Smoke-free workplace policies are the only effective 
approach to ensure that SHS exposure does not occur in 
the workplace (<I>1</I>).<SUP>&#134;</SUP> Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate 
SHS exposure (<I>1</I>). Smoke-free laws and policies 
reduce SHS exposure and improve health among nonsmoking restaurant 
and bar employees, and reduce SHS exposure among nonsmokers in general, as assessed by self-report and objective 
measures (<I>1,6--<a href="mm5628a2.htm">8</a></I>). Smoke-free workplace policies also help smokers quit 
(<I>1</I>). Smoke-free policies do not have an adverse 
economic effect on restaurants and bars (<I>1</I>). Studies also have reported high levels of public support for and compliance 
with smoke-free laws (<I>1</I>).
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the STATE System captures only 
certain types of state smoking restrictions (primarily statutory laws and executive orders) and does not capture 
state administrative laws, regulations, or implementation guidelines. As a result, the manner in which a state 
smoking restriction is implemented in practice might differ from how it is coded in the STATE System. Second, some 
state smoking restrictions apply only to private-sector worksites with more than a specified number of employees, 
to restaurants with more than a specified number of seats, or to bars of at least a certain size. In these cases, the state 
laws were coded according to the level of these restrictions, even though these restrictions do not apply to venues that 
are below the specified limits. Finally, because the STATE System only collects state-level data, it does not reflect 
local smoking restrictions in effect in many states.
</P><P>The 2006 Surgeon General's Report on <I>The Health 
Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke 
</I>concluded that SHS causes premature death and disease in children and nonsmoking adults 
(<I>1</I>). The report also concluded that no level of SHS exposure is risk free and that only completely smoke-free environments fully protect nonsmokers from 
SHS exposure (<I>1</I>). States, communities, employers, business proprietors, and the public are acting on this 
information to reduce SHS exposure. The American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation estimates that, as of April 2008, 33% of 
U.S. residents have been living under state or local laws that make worksites, restaurants, and bars completely smoke-free, 
and 

64% of U.S. residents have been living under state or local laws making at least one of these 
three settings smoke-free (<I>9</I>). Largely because of the trend 
toward increased protection by state and local smoke-free laws and voluntary 
policies covering worksites and public places, SHS exposure among U.S. nonsmokers has decreased substantially since 
1988 (<I>10</I>). The trends in the adoption of state smoking restrictions described in this 
report suggest that the national health objective of establishing laws making indoor public places and worksites 
smoke-free in all states by the year 2010 might be achievable.

* None = no restrictions; designated = designated smoking areas required or allowed; ventilated = no smoking allowed or designated smoking areas
allowed if separately ventilated; smoke-free = no smoking allowed (i.e., 100% smoke-free).
† Restriction exempts restaurants that are off-limits to minors.
§ Restriction bans smoking in most settings, but exempts separately ventilated employee break rooms or lounges.
¶ Corrected from 2005 report. Idaho and Maryland were previously listed as making private-sector workplaces smoke-free. Vermont was previously
listed as making restaurants smoke-free." width="641" height="716"><br><a href = "mm5720a3.htm#top">Return to top.</a>
