</h3><P><I>This report updates the 2007 recommendations by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
(ACIP) regarding the use of influenza vaccine and antiviral agents (CDC. Prevention and control of influenza: recommendations 
of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2007;56[No. RR-6]). The 2008 
recommendations include new and updated information. Principal updates and changes include 1) a new recommendation that 
annual vaccination be administered to all children aged 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 years, beginning in the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 influenza season, if feasible, but 
no later than the 2009<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>10 influenza season; 2) a recommendation that annual vaccination of all children aged 6 
months through 4 years (59 months) continue to be a primary focus of vaccination efforts because these children are at higher risk 
for influenza complications compared with older children; 3) a new recommendation that either trivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccine or live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) be used when vaccinating healthy persons aged 2 
through 49 years (the previous recommendation was to administer LAIV to person aged 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years); 4) a recommendation that vaccines 
containing the 2008<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 trivalent vaccine virus strains A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like, A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like, and 
B/Florida/4/2006-like antigens be used; and, 5) new information on antiviral resistance among influenza viruses in the 
United States. Persons for whom vaccination is recommended are listed in boxes 1 and 2. These recommendations also include 
a summary of safety data for U.S. licensed influenza vaccines. This report and other information are available at 
CDC's influenza website (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu">http://www.cdc.gov/flu</a>), including 
any updates or supplements to these recommendations that might 
be required during the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 influenza season. Vaccination and health-care providers should be alert to announcements 
of recommendation updates and should check the CDC influenza website periodically for additional information.</I>
</P><h3 align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Introduction</FONT></B>
</h3><P>In the United States, annual epidemics of influenza occur typically during the late fall through early spring 
seasons. Influenza viruses can cause disease among persons in any age group, but rates of infection are highest among 
children (<I>1<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>3</I>). 
Rates of serious illness and death are highest among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years, children aged &lt;2 years, and persons of 
any age who have medical conditions that place them at increased risk for complications from influenza 
(<I>1,4,5</I>). An annual average of approximately 36,000 deaths during 1990<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1999 and 226,000 hospitalizations during 1979<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2001 have been associated with influenza epidemics 
(<I>6,7</I>).
</P><P>Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective method for preventing influenza virus infection and its 
complications. Influenza vaccine can be administered to any person aged 
<U>&gt;</U>6 months (who does not have contraindications to vaccination) 
to reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting influenza to others. Trivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccine (TIV) can be used for any person aged 
<U>&gt;</U>6 months, including those with high-risk conditions 
(<a href="rr5707a1.htm#box1">Boxes 1</a> and <a href="rr5707a1.htm#box2">2</a>). Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) may be used for healthy, nonpregnant persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years. If vaccine supply 
is limited, priority for vaccination is typically assigned to persons in specific groups and of specific ages who are, or are 
contacts of, persons at higher risk for influenza complications. Because the safety or effectiveness of LAIV has not been established 
in persons with underlying medical conditions that confer a higher risk for influenza complications, these persons should only 
be vaccinated with TIV. Influenza viruses undergo frequent antigenic change (i.e., antigenic drift), and persons recommended 
for vaccination must receive an annual vaccination against the influenza viruses forecasted to be in circulation. 
Although vaccination coverage has increased in recent years for many groups targeted for routine vaccination, coverage remains 
low among most of these groups, and strategies to improve vaccination coverage, including use of reminder/recall systems 
and standing orders programs, should be implemented or expanded.
</P><P>Antiviral medications are an adjunct to vaccination and are effective when administered as treatment and when used 
for chemoprophylaxis after an exposure to influenza virus. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are the only antiviral 
medications recommended for use in the United States. Amantadine or rimantidine should not be used for the treatment or prevention 
of influenza in the United States until evidence of susceptibility to these antiviral medications has been reestablished 
among circulating influenza A viruses.
</P><h3 align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Methods</FONT></B>
</h3><P>CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides annual recommendations for the prevention 
and control of influenza. The ACIP Influenza Vaccine Working 
Group* meets monthly throughout the year to discuss 
newly published studies, review current guidelines, and consider potential revisions to the recommendations. As they 
review the annual recommendations for ACIP consideration of the full committee, members of the working group consider a variety 
of issues, including burden of influenza illness, vaccine effectiveness, safety and coverage in groups recommended for 
vaccination, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and anticipated vaccine supply. Working group members also 
request periodic updates on vaccine and antiviral production, supply, safety and efficacy from vaccinologists, epidemiologists, and manufacturers. State and 
local vaccination program representatives are consulted. Influenza surveillance and antiviral resistance data were obtained 
from CDC's Influenza Division. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products 
Advisory Committee provides advice on vaccine strain selection to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which 
selects the viral strains to be used in the annual 
trivalent influenza vaccines.
</P><P>Published, peer-reviewed studies are the primary source of data used by ACIP in making recommendations for 
the prevention and control of influenza, but unpublished data that are relevant to issues under discussion also might 
be considered. Among studies discussed or cited, those of greatest scientific quality and those that measured 
influenza-specific outcomes are the most influential. For example, population-based estimates that use outcomes associated with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection outcomes contribute the most specific data for estimates of influenza burden. The 
best evidence for vaccine or antiviral efficacy and effectiveness comes from randomized controlled trials that assess 
laboratory-confirmed influenza infections as an outcome measure and consider factors such as timing and intensity of 
influenza circulation and degree of match between vaccine strains and wild circulating strains 
(<I>8,9</I>). Randomized, placebo-controlled trials cannot be performed ethically in populations for which vaccination already is recommended, but observational 
studies that assess outcomes associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection can provide important vaccine or 
antiviral effectiveness data. Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are the best source of vaccine and antiviral safety data 
for common adverse events; however, such studies do not have the power to identify rare but potentially serious adverse 
events. The frequency of rare adverse events that might be associated with vaccination or antiviral treatment is best assessed 
by retrospective reviews of computerized medical records from large linked clinical databases, and by reviewing medical charts 
of persons who are identified as having a potential adverse event after vaccination 
(<I>10,11</I>). Vaccine coverage data from a nationally 
representative, randomly selected population that includes verification of vaccination through health-care 
record review is superior to coverage data derived from limited populations or without verification of vaccination but is 
rarely 

available for older children or adults (<I>12</I>). Finally, studies that assess vaccination program practices that improve 
vaccination coverage are most influential in formulating recommendations if the study design includes a nonintervention 
comparison group. In cited studies that included statistical comparisons, a difference was considered to be statistically significant if the 
p-value was &lt;0.05 or the 95% confidence interval (CI) around an estimate of effect allowed rejection of the null hypothesis 
(i.e., no effect).
</P><P>These recommendations were presented to the full ACIP and approved in February 2008. Modifications were made to 
the ACIP statement during the subsequent review process at CDC to update and clarify wording in the document. Data 
presented in this report were current as of July 1, 2008. Further updates, if needed, will be posted at CDC's influenza website 
(<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu">http://www.cdc.gov/flu</a>).

to routinely vaccinating all children.
</LI>
		<LI>Either TIV or LAIV can be used when vaccinating healthy persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years. Children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 years should receive 2 doses of vaccine if they have not been vaccinated previously at any time with either LAIV or TIV 
(doses separated by <U>&gt;</U>4 weeks); 2 doses are required for protection in these children. Children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 years who received only 1 dose in their first year of vaccination should receive 2 doses the following year. LAIV should not 
be administered to children aged &lt;5 years with possible reactive airways disease, such as those who have had 
recurrent wheezing or a recent wheezing episode. Children with possible reactive airways disease, persons at higher risk for 
influenza complications because of underlying medical conditions, children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months, and persons aged &gt;49 years 
should receive TIV. </LI>
		<LI>The 2008<FONT

and B/Florida/4/2006-like antigens.
</LI>
</ul>
		Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) strains have been identified in the United States and some other 
countries. However, oseltamivir or zanamivir continue to be the recommended antivirals for treatment of influenza because 
other influenza virus strains remain sensitive to oseltamivir, and resistance levels to other antiviral medications remain high.
		</P>
		<h3 align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Background and Epidemiology</FONT> 
		</h3>
		<P>Biology of Influenza</B> </P>
		<P>Influenza A and B are the two types of influenza viruses that cause epidemic human disease. Influenza A viruses 
are categorized into subtypes on the basis of two surface antigens: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Since 1977, influenza 
A (H1N1) viruses, influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and influenza B viruses have circulated globally. Influenza A 
(H1N2) viruses that probably emerged after genetic reassortment 
between human A (H3N2) and A (H1N1) viruses also have 
been identified in some influenza seasons. Both influenza A subtypes and B viruses are further separated into groups on the basis 
of antigenic similarities. New influenza virus variants result from frequent antigenic change (i.e., antigenic drift) resulting 
from point mutations that occur during viral replication 
(<I>13</I>).
</P>
		<P>Currently circulating influenza B viruses are separated into two distinct genetic lineages (Yamagata and Victoria) but are 
not categorized into subtypes. Influenza B viruses undergo antigenic drift less rapidly than influenza A viruses. Influenza B 
viruses from both lineages have circulated in most recent influenza seasons 
(<I>13</I>).
</P>
		<P>Immunity to the surface antigens, particularly the hemagglutinin, reduces the likelihood of infection 
(<I>14</I>). Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another type or subtype of influenza 
virus. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic type or subtype of influenza virus might not protect against infection with a 
new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype 
(<I>15</I>). Frequent emergence of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is 
the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and is the reason for annually reassessing the need to change one or more of 
the recommended strains for influenza vaccines. </P>
		<P>More dramatic changes, or antigenic shifts, occur less frequently. Antigenic shift occurs when a new subtype of influenza 
A virus appears and can result in the emergence of a novel influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. 
New influenza A subtypes have the potential to cause a pandemic when they are able to cause human illness and 
demonstrate efficient human-to-human transmission and there is little or no previously existing immunity among humans 
(<I>13</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Clinical Signs and Symptoms<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>of Influenza</B> </P>
		<P>Influenza viruses are spread from person to person primarily through large-particle respiratory droplet transmission 
(e.g., when an infected person coughs or sneezes near a susceptible person) 
(<I>16</I>). Transmission via large-particle droplets 
requires close contact between source and recipient persons, because droplets do not remain suspended in the air and generally 
travel only a short distance (<U>&lt;</U>1 meter) through the air. Contact with respiratory-droplet contaminated surfaces is another 
possible source of transmission. Airborne transmission (via small-particle residue 
[<U>&lt;</U>5&#181;m] of evaporated droplets that might 
remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) also is thought to be possible, although data supporting airborne 
transmission are limited (<I>16<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>21</I>). The typical incubation period for influenza is 1<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 days (average: 2 days) 
(<I>13</I>). Adults shed influenza virus from the day before symptoms begin through 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>10 days after illness onset 
(<I>22,23</I>). However, the amount of virus shed, and presumably infectivity, decreases rapidly by 3<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>5 days after onset in an experimental human infection model 
(<I>24,25</I>). Young children also might shed virus several days before illness onset, and children can be infectious for 
		<U>&gt;</U>10 days after onset of symptoms 
(<I>26</I>). Severely immunocompromised persons can shed virus for weeks or months 
(<I>27<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>30</I>).

		<P>Uncomplicated influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of constitutional and respiratory signs and 
symptoms (e.g., fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis) 
(<I>31</I>). Among children, otitis media, nausea, and vomiting also are commonly reported with influenza illness 
(<I>32,33</I>). Uncomplicated influenza illness 
typically resolves after 3<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>7 days for the majority of persons, 
although cough and malaise can persist for &gt;2 weeks. However, 
influenza virus infections can cause primary influenza viral pneumonia; exacerbate underlying medical conditions (e.g., pulmonary 
or cardiac disease); lead to secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinusitis, or otitis media; or contribute to coinfections with other 
viral or bacterial pathogens (<I>34<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>36</I>). Young children with influenza virus infection might have initial symptoms 
mimicking bacterial sepsis with high fevers (<I>35<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>38</I>), and febrile seizures have been reported in 6%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>20% of children hospitalized 
with influenza virus infection (<I>32,35,39</I>). Population-based studies among hospitalized children with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza have demonstrated that although the majority of hospitalizations are brief 
(<U>&lt;</U>2 days), 4%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>11% of children hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza required treatment in the intensive care unit, and 3% required 
mechanical ventilation (<I>35,37</I>). Among 1,308 hospitalized children in one study, 80% were aged 
&lt;5 years, and 27% were aged &lt;6 months 
(<I>35</I>). Influenza virus infection also has been uncommonly associated with encephalopathy, transverse myelitis, 
myositis, myocarditis, pericarditis, and Reye syndrome 
(<I>32,34,40,41</I>).
</P>
		<P>Respiratory illnesses caused by influenza virus infection are difficult to distinguish from illnesses caused by other 
respiratory pathogens on the basis of signs and symptoms alone. Sensitivity and predictive value of clinical definitions vary, depending 
on the prevalence of other respiratory pathogens and the level of influenza activity 
(<I>42</I>). Among generally healthy older adolescents and adults living in areas with confirmed influenza virus circulation, estimates of the positive predictive value of 
a simple clinical definition of influenza (acute onset of cough and fever) for laboratory-confirmed 
influenza infection have varied (range: 79%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>88%) (<I>43,44</I>).
</P>
		<P>Young children are less likely to report typical influenza symptoms (e.g., fever and cough). In studies conducted 
among children aged 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>12 years, the positive predictive value of 
fever and cough together was 71%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>83%, compared with 64% among children aged &lt;5 years 
(<I>45</I>). In one large, population-based surveillance study in which all children with fever 
or 

symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection were tested for influenza, 70% of hospitalized children aged &lt;6 months 
with laboratory-confirmed influenza were reported to have fever and cough, compared with 91% of hospitalized children aged 
6 months<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>5 years. Among children who subsequently were shown to have laboratory-confirmed influenza infections, only 
28% of those hospitalized and 17% of those treated as outpatients had a discharge diagnosis of influenza 
(<I>38</I>).
</P>
		<P>Clinical definitions have performed poorly in some studies of older patients. A study of nonhospitalized patients aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>60 years indicated that the presence of fever, cough, and acute onset had a positive predictive value of 30% for influenza 
(<I>46</I>). Among hospitalized patients aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years with chronic cardiopulmonary disease, a combination of fever, cough, and 
illness of &lt;7 days had a positive predictive value of 53% for confirmed influenza infection 
(<I>47</I>). In addition, the absence of symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) does not effectively rule out influenza; among hospitalized adults with 
laboratory-confirmed infection in two studies, 44%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>51% had typical ILI symptoms 
(<I>48,49</I>). A study of vaccinated older persons 
with chronic lung disease reported that cough was not predictive of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection, 
although having both fever or feverishness and myalgia had a positive predictive value of 41% 
(<I>50</I>). These results highlight the challenges 
of identifying influenza illness in the absence of laboratory confirmation and indicate that the diagnosis of influenza should 
be considered in patients with respiratory symptoms or fever during influenza season.

		<P><B>Health-Care Use, Hospitalizations, and Deaths 
Attributed to Influenza</B> </P>
		<P>In the United States, annual epidemics of influenza typically occur during the fall or winter months, but the peak 
of influenza activity can occur as late as April or May 
(<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Influenza-related complications requiring urgent medical 
care, including hospitalizations or deaths, can result from the 
direct effects of influenza virus infection, from 
complications associated with age or pregnancy, or from complications of underlying cardiopulmonary conditions or other chronic 
diseases. Studies that have measured rates of a clinical outcome without a laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection 
(e.g., respiratory illness requiring hospitalization during influenza season) to assess the effect of influenza can be difficult to 
interpret because of circulation of other respiratory pathogens (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus) during the same time as influenza 
viruses (<I>51<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>53</I>).
</P>
		<P>During seasonal influenza epidemics from 1979<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1980 through 2000<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2001, the estimated annual overall number 
of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States ranged from approximately 55,000 to 431,000 per annual 
epidemic (mean: 226,000) (<I>7</I>). The estimated annual number of deaths attributed to influenza from the 1990<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>91 influenza season through 1998<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>99 ranged from 17,000 to 51,000 per epidemic (mean: 36,000) 
(<I>6</I>). In the United States, the estimated number of influenza-associated deaths increased during 1990<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1999. This increase was attributed in part to the 
substantial increase in the number of persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years who were at increased risk for death from influenza complications 
(<I>6</I>). In one study, an average of approximately 19,000 influenza-associated pulmonary and circulatory deaths per influenza 
season occurred during 1976<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1990, compared with an average of approximately 36,000 deaths per season during 1990<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1999 (<I>6</I>). In addition, influenza A (H3N2) 
viruses, which have been associated with higher mortality 
(<I>54</I>), predominated in 90% of influenza seasons during 1990<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1999, compared with 57% of seasons during 1976<FONT

</P>
		<P>Influenza viruses cause disease among persons in all age groups 
(<I>1<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>5</I>). Rates of infection are highest among children, but 
the risks for complications, hospitalizations, and deaths from influenza are higher among persons aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>65 years, young children, and persons of any age who have medical conditions that place them at increased risk for complications from 
influenza (<I>1,4,5,55<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>58</I>). Estimated rates of 
influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths varied substantially by age group in 
studies conducted during different influenza epidemics. During 1990<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1999, estimated average rates of 
influenza-associated pulmonary and circulatory deaths per 100,000 persons were 0.4<FONT

</P>
		<P><B>Children</B> </P>
		<P>Among children aged &lt;5 years, influenza-related illness is a common cause of visits to medical practices and 
emergency departments. During two influenza seasons (2002<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>03 and 2003<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>04), the percentage of visits among children 
aged &lt;5 years with acute respiratory illness or fever caused by 
laboratory-confirmed influenza ranged from 10%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>19% of medical office visits to 6%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>29% of emergency departments visits during the influenza season. Using these data, the rate of visits 
to medical clinics for influenza was estimated to be 50<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>95 per 1,000 children, and to emergency departments 
6<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>27 per 1,000 children 
(<I>38</I>). Retrospective studies using medical records data have demonstrated similar rates of illness among children 
aged 

&lt;5 years during other influenza seasons 
(<I>33,56,59</I>). During the influenza season, an estimated 7<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>12 additional outpatient visits and 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>7 additional antibiotic prescriptions per 100 children aged &lt;15 years has been documented when compared 
with periods when influenza viruses are not circulating, with rates decreasing with increasing age of the child 
(<I>59</I>). During 1993<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2004 in the Boston area, the rate of emergency department visits for respiratory illness that was attributed to influenza 
virus based on viral surveillance data among children aged 
<U>&lt;</U>7 years during the winter respiratory illness season ranged from 22.0 
per 1000 children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months to 5.4 per 1000 children aged 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>7 years (<I>60</I>).
</P>
		<P>Rates of influenza-associated hospitalization are substantially higher among infants and young children than among 
older children when influenza viruses are in circulation 
(<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#fig2">Figure 2</a>) and are similar to rates for other groups considered at high risk 
for influenza-related complications (<I>61<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>66</I>), including persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years (<I>59,63</I>). During 1979<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2001, the estimated rate 
of influenza-associated hospitalizations, using a national sample of hospital discharges of influenza-associated hospitalizations 
in the United States among children aged &lt;5 
years, was 108 hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years 
(<I>7</I>). Recent population-based studies that measured hospitalization rates for laboratory-confirmed influenza in young children 
documented hospitalization rates that are similar to or higher than rates derived from studies that analyzed hospital discharge 
data (<I>33,35,36,38,65</I>). Annual hospitalization rates for laboratory-confirmed influenza decrease with increasing age, ranging 
from 240<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>720 per 100,000 children aged 
&lt;6 months to approximately 20 per 100,000 children aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>5 years (<I>38</I>). Hospitalization rates for children aged &lt;5 years with high-risk medical conditions are approximately 250<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>500 per 100,000 children 
(<I>56,58,67</I>).
</P>
		<P>Influenza-associated deaths are uncommon among children. An estimated annual average of 92 influenza-related deaths 
(0.4 deaths per 100,000 persons) occurred among children aged &lt;5 years during the 1990s, compared with 32,651 deaths 
(98.3 per 100,000 persons) among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years (<I>6</I>). Of 153 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related pediatric 
deaths reported during the 2003<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>04 influenza season, 96 (63%) deaths occurred among children aged &lt;5 years and 61 (40%) 
among children aged &lt;2 years. Among the 149 children who died and for whom information on underlying health status 
was available, 100 (67%) did not have an underlying medical condition that was an indication for vaccination at that time 
(<I>68</I>). In California during the 2003<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>04 and 2004<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>05 influenza seasons, 51% of children with laboratory-confirmed 
influenza who died and 40% of those who required admission to an intensive care unit had no underlying medical conditions 
(<I>69</I>). These data indicate that although deaths are more common among children with risk factors for influenza complications, 
the majority of pediatric deaths occur among children of all age groups with no known high-risk conditions. The annual 
number of deaths among children reported to CDC for the past four influenza seasons has ranged from 84 during 2004<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>05 to 84 during 2007<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 (CDC, unpublished data, 2008).
</P>
		<P>Death associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza 
virus infection among children (defined as persons aged 
&lt;18 years) is a nationally reportable condition. Deaths among children that have been attributed to co-infection with influenza 
and <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, particularly methicillin resistant 
<I>S. aureus </I>(MRSA), have increased during the preceding 
four influenza seasons (<I><a href="mm5631a2.htm">70</a></I>; CDC, unpublished data, 2008). The reason for this increase is not established but might reflect 
an increasing prevalence within the general population of colonization with MRSA strains, some of which carry 
certain virulence factors (<I>71,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5614a1.htm">72</a></I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Adults</B> </P>
		<P>Hospitalization rates during the influenza season are substantially increased for persons aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>65 years. One retrospective analysis based on data from managed-care organizations collected during 1996<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2000 estimated that the risk during 
influenza season among persons aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years with underlying conditions that put them at risk for influenza-related 
complications (i.e., one or more of the conditions listed as indications for vaccination) was approximately 560 
influenza-associated hospitalizations per 100,000 persons, compared with approximately 190 per 100,000 healthy elderly persons. Persons 
aged 50<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years with underlying medical conditions also were at substantially increased risk for hospitalizations during 
influenza season, compared with healthy adults aged 50<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years. No increased risk for influenza-associated hospitalizations 
was demonstrated among healthy adults aged 50<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years or among those aged 19<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years, regardless of underlying 
medical conditions (<I>64</I>).
</P>
		<P>Influenza is an important contributor to the annual increase in deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza that 
is observed during the winter months (<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#fig3">Figure 3</a>). During 1976<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2001, an estimated yearly average of 32,651 (90%) 
influenza-related deaths occurred among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years (<I>6</I>). Risk for influenza-associated death was highest among the 
oldest 

elderly, with persons aged <U>&gt;</U>85 years 16 times more likely to die from an influenza-associated illness than persons 
aged 65<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>69 years 
(<I>6</I>).
</P>
		<P>The duration of influenza symptoms is prolonged and the severity of influenza illness increased among persons with 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (<I>73<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>77</I>). A retrospective study of young and middle-aged women enrolled 
in Tennessee's Medicaid program determined that the attributable risk for cardiopulmonary hospitalizations among women 
with HIV infection was higher during influenza seasons than it was either before or after influenza was circulating. The risk 
for hospitalization was higher for HIV-infected women than it was for women with other underlying medical conditions 
(<I>78</I>). Another study estimated that the risk for 
influenza-related death was 94<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>146 deaths per 100,000 persons with 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), compared with 0.9<FONT

		<P>Influenza-associated excess deaths among pregnant women were reported during the pandemics of 1918<FONT

COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1958 (<I>80<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>83</I>). Case reports and several epidemiologic studies also indicate that pregnancy increases the risk for 
influenza complications (<I>84<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>89</I>) for the mother. The majority of studies that have attempted to assess the effect of influenza 
on pregnant women have measured changes in excess hospitalizations for respiratory illness during influenza season but 
not laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations. Pregnant women have an increased number of medical visits for 
respiratory illnesses during influenza season compared with nonpregnant women 
(<I>90</I>). Hospitalized pregnant women with 
respiratory illness during influenza season have increased lengths of stay compared with hospitalized pregnant women without 
respiratory illness. Rates of hospitalization for respiratory illness were twice as common during 
influenza season (<I>91</I>). A retrospective cohort study of approximately 134,000 pregnant women conducted in Nova Scotia during 1990<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2002 compared medical record data for pregnant women to data from the same women during the year before pregnancy. Among pregnant 
women, 0.4% were hospitalized and 25% visited a clinician during pregnancy for a respiratory illness. The rate of 
third-trimester hospital admissions during the influenza 
season was five times higher than the rate during the influenza season in the 
year before pregnancy and more than twice as high as the rate during the noninfluenza season. An excess of 1,210 
hospital admissions in the third trimester per 100,000 pregnant women with comorbidities and 68 
admissions per 100,000 women without comorbidities was reported 
(<I>92</I>). In one study, pregnant women with respiratory hospitalizations did not have 
an increase in adverse perinatal outcomes or delivery complications 
(<I>93</I>); however, another study indicated an increase in 
delivery complications (<I>91</I>). However, infants born to women with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza during pregnancy do not 
have higher rates of low birth weight, congenital abnormalities, or low Apgar scores compared with infants born to 
uninfected women (<I>88,94</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Options for Controlling Influenza</B> </P>
		<P>The most effective strategy for preventing influenza is 
annual vaccination. Strategies that focus on providing 
routine vaccination to persons at higher risk for influenza complications have long been recommended, although coverage among 
the majority of these groups remains low. Routine vaccination of certain persons (e.g., children, contacts of persons at risk 
for influenza complications, and HCP) who serve as a source of influenza virus transmission might provide additional 
protection to persons at risk for influenza complications and reduce the overall influenza burden, but coverage levels among these 
persons needs to be increased before effects on transmission can be reliably measured. Antiviral drugs used for chemoprophylaxis 
or treatment of influenza are adjuncts to vaccine but are not substitutes for annual vaccination. However, antiviral drugs 
might be underused among those hospitalized with influenza 
(<I>95</I>). Nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g., advising 
frequent handwashing and improved respiratory hygiene) are reasonable and inexpensive; these strategies have been demonstrated 
to reduce respiratory diseases (<I>96,97</I>) but have not been studied adequately to 
determine if they reduce transmission of influenza virus. Similarly, few data are available to assess the effects of community-level respiratory disease mitigation strategies 
(e.g., closing schools, avoiding mass gatherings, or using respiratory protection) on reducing influenza virus transmission 
during typical seasonal influenza epidemics 
(<I>98,99</I>).

		<P>Evaluating Influenza Vaccine Efficacy and Effectiveness Studies</B>
		</P>
		<P>The efficacy (i.e., prevention of illness among vaccinated persons in controlled trials) and effectiveness (i.e., prevention 
of illness in vaccinated populations) of influenza vaccines 
depend in part on the age and immunocompetence of the 
vaccine recipient, the degree of similarity between the viruses in the vaccine and those in circulation (see Effectiveness of 
Influenza Vaccination when Circulating Influenza Virus Strains Differ from Vaccine Strains), and the outcome being 
measured. Influenza vaccine efficacy and effectiveness studies have used multiple possible outcome measures, including the prevention 
of medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI), prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza 
virus illness, prevention of influenza or pneumonia-associated hospitalizations or deaths, or prevention of seroconversion to circulating influenza 
virus strains. Efficacy or effectiveness for more specific outcomes such as laboratory-confirmed influenza typically will be 
higher than for less specific outcomes such as MAARI because the causes of MAARI include infections with other pathogens 
that influenza vaccination would not be expected to prevent 
(<I>100</I>). Observational studies that compare less-specific 
outcomes among vaccinated populations to those among unvaccinated populations are subject to 
biases that are difficult to control for during analyses. For 
example, an observational study that determines that influenza vaccination reduces overall 
mortality might be biased if healthier persons in the study are more likely to be vaccinated 
(<I>101,102</I>). Randomized controlled trials 
that measure laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections as the outcome are the most persuasive evidence of vaccine 
efficacy, but such trials cannot be conducted ethically among groups recommended to receive vaccine annually.
		</P>
		<P><B>Influenza Vaccine Composition</B> </P>
		<P>Both LAIV and TIV contain strains of influenza viruses that are antigenically equivalent to the annually 
recommended strains: one influenza A (H3N2) virus, one influenza A (H1N1) virus, and one influenza B virus. Each year, one or more 
virus strains in the vaccine might be changed on the basis of global surveillance for influenza viruses and the emergence and 
spread of new strains. All three vaccine virus strains were changed for the recommended vaccine for the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 influenza season, compared with the 2007<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 season (see Recommendations for Using TIV and LAIV During the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 Influenza Season). Viruses for both types of currently 
licensed vaccines are grown in eggs. Both vaccines are administered annually to 
provide optimal protection against influenza virus infection 
(<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). Both TIV and LAIV are widely available in the United 
States. Although both types of vaccines are expected to be effective, the vaccines differ in several respects 
(<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>).
</P>
		<P><B>Major Differences Between TIV<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>and LAIV</B> </P>
		<P>During the preparation of TIV, the vaccine viruses are made noninfectious (i.e., inactivated or killed) 
(<I>103</I>). Only subvirion and purified surface antigen preparations of TIV (often 
referred to as &quot;split&quot; and subunit vaccines, respectively) are available 
in the United States. TIV contains killed viruses and thus cannot cause influenza. LAIV contains live, attenuated viruses 
that have the potential to cause mild signs or symptoms such as runny nose, nasal congestion, fever or sore throat. LAIV 
is administered intranasally by sprayer, whereas TIV is administered intramuscularly by injection. LAIV is licensed for 
use among nonpregnant persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years; safety has not been established in persons with underlying medical 
conditions that confer a higher risk of influenza complications. TIV is licensed for use among persons aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>6 months, including those who are healthy and those with chronic medical conditions (<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>).
		</P>
		<P><B>Correlates of Protection after Vaccination</B> </P>
		<P>Immune correlates of protection against influenza infection after vaccination include serum hemagglutination 
inhibition antibody and neutralizing antibody 
(<I>14,104</I>). Increased levels of antibody induced by vaccination decrease the risk for 
illness caused by strains that are antigenically similar to those strains of the same type or subtype included in the vaccine 
(<I>105<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>108</I>). The majority of healthy children and adults have high titers of antibody after vaccination 
(<I>106,109</I>). Although immune correlates such as achievement of certain antibody titers after vaccination correlate well with immunity on a population 
level, the significance of reaching or failing to reach a certain antibody threshold is not well understood on the individual 
level. Other immunologic correlates of protection that might best indicate clinical protection after receipt of an 
intranasal vaccine such as LAIV (e.g., mucosal antibody) are more difficult to measure 
(<I>103,110</I>).

		<P>Children</B> </P>
		<P>Children aged <U>&gt;</U>6 months typically have protective levels of anti-influenza antibody against specific influenza virus strains 
after receiving the recommended number of doses of influenza vaccine 
(<I>104,109,111<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>116</I>). In most seasons, one or more 
vaccine antigens are changed compared to the previous season. In consecutive years when vaccine antigens change, children aged &lt;9 
years who received only 1 dose of vaccine in their first year of vaccination are less likely to have protective antibody responses 
when administered only a single dose during their second year of vaccination, compared with children who received 2 doses in their 
first year of vaccination (<I>117<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>119</I>).
</P>
		<P>When the vaccine antigens do not change from one season to the next, priming children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months with a single dose of vaccine in the spring followed by a dose in the fall engenders similar antibody responses compared with a regimen of 
2 doses in the fall (<I>120</I>). However, one study conducted during a season when the vaccine antigens did not change 
compared with the previous season estimated 62% effectiveness against ILI for healthy children who had received only 1 dose in 
the previous influenza season and only 1 dose in the study season, compared with 82% for those who 
received 2 doses separated by &gt;4 weeks during the study season 
(<I>121</I>).
</P>
		<P>The antibody response among children at higher risk for influenza-related complications (e.g., children with 
chronic medical conditions) might be lower than those typically 
reported among healthy children (<I>122,123</I>). However, 
antibody responses among children with asthma are similar to those of healthy children and are not substantially altered during 
asthma exacerbations requiring short-term prednisone treatment 
(<I>124</I>).

		<P>Vaccine effectiveness studies also have indicated that 2 doses are needed to provide adequate protection during the 
first season that young children are vaccinated. Among children aged &lt;5 years who have never received influenza vaccine 
previously or who received only 1 dose of influenza vaccine in their first year of vaccination, vaccine effectiveness is lower compared 
with children who receive 2 doses in their first year of being vaccinated. Two recent, large retrospective studies of young 
children who had received only 1 dose of TIV in their first year of being vaccinated determined that no decrease was observed in 
ILI-related office visits compared with unvaccinated children 
(<I>121,125</I>). Similar results were reported in a case-control study 
of children aged 6<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>59 months 
(<I>126</I>). These results, along with the immunogenicity data indicating that antibody responses 
are significantly higher when young children are given 2 doses, are the basis for the recommendation that all children aged 
&lt;9 years who are being vaccinated for the first time should receive 2 vaccine doses separated by at least 4 weeks.
		</P>
		<P>Certain studies have demonstrated vaccine efficacy or effectiveness among children aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>6 months, although estimates have varied. In a randomized trial conducted during five 
influenza seasons (1985<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1990) in the United States among children 
aged 1<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>15 years, annual vaccination reduced 
laboratory-confirmed influenza A substantially (77%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>91%) (<I>106</I>). A limited 
1-year placebo-controlled study reported vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness of 56% among 
healthy children aged 3<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>9 years and 100% among healthy children and adolescents aged 10<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 years (<I>127</I>). A randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted during two influenza seasons among children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>24 months indicated that efficacy was 66% against 
culture-confirmed influenza illness during 1999<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2000, but did not significantly reduce 
culture-confirmed influenza illness during 2000<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2001 (<I>128</I>). In a nonrandomized controlled trial among children aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>6 years and 7<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>14 years who had asthma, vaccine efficacy was 54% and 78% against 
laboratory-confirmed influenza type A infection and 22% and 60% against laboratory-confirmed influenza type B infection, 
respectively. Vaccinated children aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>6 years with asthma did not have substantially fewer type B influenza virus infections compared with the control group in this 
study (<I>129</I>). Vaccination also might provide protection against asthma 
exacerbations (<I>130</I>); however, other studies of children 
with asthma have not demonstrated decreased exacerbations 
(<I>131</I>). Because of the recognized influenza-related disease 
burden among children with other chronic diseases or immunosuppression and the long-standing recommendation for vaccination 
of these children, randomized placebo-controlled studies to study efficacy in these children have not been conducted because 
of ethical considerations.
</P>
		<P>A retrospective study conducted among approximately 30,000 children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 years during an influenza 
season (2003<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>04) with a suboptimal vaccine match indicated vaccine effectiveness of 51% against medically attended, 
clinically diagnosed pneumonia or influenza (i.e., no laboratory confirmation of influenza) among fully vaccinated children, and 
49% among approximately 5,000 children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months (<I>125</I>). Another retrospective study of similar size conducted 
during the same influenza season in Denver but limited to healthy children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>21 months estimated clinical effectiveness of 
2 

TIV doses to be 87% against pneumonia or influenza-related office visits 
(<I>121</I>). Among children, TIV effectiveness 
might increase with age (<I>106,132</I>).
</P>
		<P>TIV has been demonstrated to reduce acute otitis media in some studies. Two studies have reported that TIV decreases 
the risk for influenza-associated otitis media by approximately 30% among children with mean ages of 20 and 27 
months, respectively (<I>133,134</I>). However, a large study conducted among children with a mean age of 14 months indicated that 
TIV was not effective against acute otitis media 
(<I>128</I>). Influenza vaccine effectiveness against acute otitis media, which is caused 
by a variety of pathogens and is not typically diagnosed using influenza virus culture, would be expected to be relatively low 
when assessing a nonspecific clinical outcome.
</P>
		<P><B>Adults Aged &lt;65 Years</B> </P>
		<P>One dose of TIV is highly immunogenic in healthy adults aged &lt;65 years. Limited or no increase in antibody response 
is reported among adults when a second dose is administered during the same season 
(<I>135<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>139</I>). When the vaccine 
and circulating viruses are antigenically similar, TIV prevents laboratory-confirmed influenza illness among approximately 70%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>90% of healthy adults aged &lt;65 years in randomized controlled trials 
(<I>139<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>142</I>). Vaccination of healthy adults also 
has resulted in decreased work absenteeism and decreased use of health-care resources, including use of antibiotics, when 
the vaccine and circulating viruses are well-matched 
(<I>139<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>141,143<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>145</I>). Efficacy or effectiveness against 
laboratory-confirmed influenza illness was 50%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>77% in studies conducted during different influenza seasons when the vaccine strains 
were antigenically dissimilar to the majority of circulating strains 
(<I>139,141,145<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>147</I>). However, effectiveness among healthy 
adults against influenza-related hospitalization, measured in the most recent of these studies, was 90% 
(<I>147</I>).
</P>
		<P>In certain studies, persons with certain chronic diseases have lower serum antibody responses after vaccination 
compared with healthy young adults and can remain susceptible to 
influenza virus infection and influenza-related upper respiratory 
tract illness (<I>148<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>150</I>). Vaccine effectiveness among adults aged &lt;65 years who are at higher risk for influenza complications 
is typically lower than that reported for healthy adults. In a case-control study conducted during 2003<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2004, when the vaccine was a suboptimal antigenic match to many circulating virus strains, effectiveness for prevention of 
laboratory-confirmed influenza illness among adults aged 50<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years with high risk conditions was 48%, compared with 60% for healthy 
adults (<I>147</I>). Effectiveness against hospitalization among adults aged 50<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years with high-risk conditions was 36%, 
compared with 90% effectiveness among healthy adults in that age range 
(<I>147</I>). A randomized controlled trial among adults in 
Thailand with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (median age: 68 years) indicated a vaccine effectiveness of 76% in 
preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza during a season when viruses were well-matched to vaccine viruses. Effectiveness did 
not decrease with increasing severity of underlying 
lung disease (<I>151</I>).
</P>
		<P>Studies using less specific outcomes, without laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection, typically 
have demonstrated substantial reductions in hospitalizations or deaths among adults with risk factors for influenza 
complications. In a case-control study conducted in Denmark among adults with underlying medical conditions aged &lt;65 years during 1999<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2000, vaccination reduced deaths attributable to any cause 78% and reduced hospitalizations attributable to 
respiratory infections or cardiopulmonary diseases 87% 
(<I>152</I>). A benefit was reported after the first vaccination and increased 
with subsequent vaccinations in subsequent years 
(<I>153</I>). Among patients with diabetes mellitus, vaccination was associated with 
a 56% reduction in any complication, a 54% reduction in hospitalizations, and a 58% reduction in deaths 
(<I>154</I>). Certain experts have noted that the substantial effects on morbidity and mortality among those who received influenza vaccination 
in these observational studies should be interpreted with caution because of the difficulties in ensuring that those who 
received vaccination had similar baseline health status as those who did not 
(<I>101,102</I>). One meta-analysis of published studies did 
not determine sufficient evidence to conclude that persons with asthma benefit from vaccination 
(<I>155</I>). However, a meta-analysis that examined effectiveness among persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease identified evidence of benefit 
from vaccination (<I>156</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Immunocompromised Persons</B> </P>
		<P>TIV produces adequate antibody concentrations against 
influenza among vaccinated HIV-infected persons who have 
minimal AIDS-related symptoms and normal or near-normal CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts 
(<I>157<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>159</I>). Among persons who 
have advanced HIV disease and low CD4+ 
T-lymphocyte cell counts, TIV might not induce protective antibody titers 
(<I>159,160</I>); a second dose of vaccine does not improve the immune response in these persons 
(<I>160,161</I>). A randomized, placebo-controlled trial determined that TIV was highly 
effective in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed 
influenza virus infection 

among HIV-infected persons with a mean of 400 CD4+ T-lymphocyte cells/mm3; however, a limited number of persons 
with CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts of &lt;200 were included in that study 
(<I>161</I>). A nonrandomized study of HIV-infected 
persons determined that influenza vaccination was most effective among persons with &gt;100 CD4+ cells and among those 
with &lt;30,000 viral copies of HIV type-1/mL 
(<I>77</I>).
</P>
		<P>On the basis of certain small studies, immunogenicity for persons with solid organ transplants varies according to 
transplant type. Among persons with kidney or heart transplants, the proportion who developed seroprotective antibody 
concentrations was similar or slightly reduced compared with healthy persons 
(<I>162<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>164</I>). However, a study among persons with 
liver transplants indicated reduced immunologic responses 
to influenza vaccination (<I>165<FONT

occurred within the 4 months after the transplant procedure 
(<I>165</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Pregnant Women and Neonates</B> </P>
		<P>Pregnant women have protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies after vaccination 
(<I>168,169</I>). Passive transfer of anti-influenza antibodies that might provide protection from vaccinated women to neonates has been reported 
(<I>168,170<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>172</I>). 
A retrospective, clinic-based study conducted during 1998<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2003 documented a nonsignificant trend towards fewer episodes 
of MAARI during one influenza season among vaccinated pregnant women compared with unvaccinated pregnant women 
and substantially fewer episodes of MAARI during the peak influenza season 
(<I>169</I>). However, a retrospective study 
conducted during 1997<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2002 that used clinical records data did not indicate a reduction in ILI among vaccinated pregnant women 
or their infants (<I>173</I>). In another study conducted during 1995<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2001, medical visits for respiratory illness among the 
infants were not substantially reduced (<I>174</I>). However, studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness among pregnant women have 
not included specific outcomes such as laboratory-confirmed influenza in women or their infants.
		</P>
		<P><B>Older Adults</B> </P>
		<P>Adults aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years typically have a diminished immune response to influenza vaccination compared with young 
healthy adults, suggesting that immunity might be of shorter duration (although still extending through one influenza 
season) (<I>175,176</I>). However, a review of the published literature concluded that no clear evidence existed that 
immunity declined more rapidly in the elderly 
(<I>177</I>). Infections among the vaccinated elderly might be associated with an 
age-related reduction in ability to respond to vaccination rather than 
reduced duration of immunity (<I>149<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>150</I>).
</P>
		<P>The only randomized controlled trial among community-dwelling persons aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>60 years reported a vaccine efficacy of 58% against influenza respiratory illness during a season when the vaccine strains were considered to be well-matched 
to circulating strains, but indicated that efficacy was lower among those aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>70 years (<I>178</I>). Influenza vaccine effectiveness 
in preventing MAARI among the elderly in nursing homes has been estimated at 20%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>40% (<I>179,180</I>), and reported 
outbreaks among well-vaccinated nursing home populations have suggested that vaccination might not have any 
significant effectiveness when circulating strains are drifted from vaccine strains 
(<I>181,182</I>). In contrast, some studies have indicated 
that vaccination can be up to 80% effective in preventing 
influenza-related death (<I>179,183<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>185</I>). Among elderly persons 
not living in nursing homes or similar chronic-care 
facilities, influenza vaccine is 27%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>70% effective in preventing 
hospitalization for pneumonia and influenza (<I>186<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>188</I>). Influenza vaccination reduces the frequency of secondary complications and 
reduces the risk for influenza-related hospitalization and death among community-dwelling adults aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>65 years with and without high-risk medical conditions (e.g., heart disease and diabetes) 
(<I>187<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>192</I>). However, studies demonstrating large reductions 
in hospitalizations and deaths among the vaccinated elderly have been conducted using medical record databases and have 
not measured reductions in laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. These studies have been challenged because of concerns 
that they have not adequately controlled for differences in the propensity for healthier persons to be more likely than less 
healthy persons to receive vaccination (<I>101,102,183,193<FONT

</P>
		<P><B>TIV Dosage, Administration,<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>and Storage</B> </P>
		<P>The composition of TIV varies according to manufacturer, and package inserts should be consulted. TIV formulations 
in multidose vials contain the vaccine preservative thimerosal; preservative-free single dose preparations also are available. 
TIV should be stored at 35&#176;F<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>46&#176;F (2&#176;C<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8&#176;C) and should not be frozen. TIV that has been frozen should be discarded. 
Dosage recommendations and schedules vary according to age group 
(<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). Vaccine prepared for a previous influenza 
season should not be administered to provide protection for any subsequent season.
		</P>
		<P>The intramuscular route is recommended for TIV. Adults and older children should be vaccinated in the deltoid muscle. 
A needle length of <U>&gt;</U>1 inch (&gt;25 mm) should be considered for persons in these age groups because needles of &lt;1 inch might 
be of insufficient length to penetrate muscle tissue in certain adults and older children 
(<I>196</I>). When injecting into the deltoid muscle among children with adequate deltoid muscle mass, a needle length of 7/8<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1.25 inches is recommended 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5515a1.htm">197</a></I>).

		<P>Infants and young children should be vaccinated in the 
anterolateral aspect of the thigh. A needle length of 7/8<FONT

		</P>
		<P><B>Adverse Events after Receipt of TIV
</P>
		<P>Children</B> </P>
		<P>Studies support the safety of annual TIV in children and adolescents. The largest published postlicensure 
population-based study assessed TIV safety in 215,600 children aged &lt;18 years and 8,476 children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months enrolled in one of 
five health maintenance organizations (HMOs) during 1993<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1999. This study indicated no increase in biologically 
plausible, medically attended events during the 2 weeks after inactivated influenza vaccination, compared with control 
periods 3<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 weeks before and after vaccination 
(<I>198</I>). A retrospective study using medical records data from approximately 
45,000 children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months provided additional evidence supporting overall safety of TIV in this age group. Vaccination 
was not associated with statistically significant increases in any medically attended outcome, and 13 diagnoses, including 
acute upper respiratory illness, otitis media and asthma, were significantly less common 
(<I>199</I>).
</P>
		<P>In a study of 791 healthy children aged 1<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>15 years, postvaccination fever was noted among 11.5% of those aged 1<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>5 years, 4.6% among those aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>10 years, and 5.1% among those aged 11<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>15 years (<I>106</I>). Fever, malaise, myalgia, and 
other systemic symptoms that can occur after vaccination with inactivated vaccine most often affect persons who have had 
no previous exposure to the influenza virus antigens in the vaccine (e.g., young children) 
(<I>200,201</I>). These reactions begin 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>12 hours after vaccination and can persist for 1<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2 days. Data about potential adverse events among children 
after influenza vaccination are available from the Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). A recently published review of 
VAERS reports submitted after administration of TIV to children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months documented that the most frequently 
reported adverse events were fever, rash, injection-site reactions, and seizures; the majority of the limited number of reported 
seizures appeared to be febrile (<I>202</I>). Because of the limitations of passive reporting systems, determining causality for specific types 
of adverse events, with the exception of injection-site reactions, usually is not possible using VAERS data alone.
		</P>
		<P><B>Adults</B> </P>
		<P>In placebo-controlled studies among adults, the most frequent side effect of vaccination was soreness at the vaccination 
site (affecting 10%<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64% of patients) that lasted &lt;2 days 
(<I>203,204</I>). These local reactions typically were mild and rarely 
interfered with the recipients' ability to conduct usual daily activities. Placebo-controlled trials demonstrate that among older 
persons and healthy young adults, administration of TIV is not associated with higher rates for systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, 
malaise, myalgia, and headache) when compared with placebo injections 
(<I>139,155, 203<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>205</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Pregnant Women and Neonates</B> </P>
		<P>FDA has classified TIV as a &quot;Pregnancy Category C&quot; medication, indicating that animal reproduction studies have not 
been conducted to support a labeling change. Available data indicate that influenza vaccine does not cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproductive 
capacity. One study of approximately 2,000 pregnant women 
who received TIV during pregnancy demonstrated no adverse fetal effects and no adverse effects during infancy or early 
childhood (<I>206</I>). A matched case-control study of 252 pregnant women who received TIV within the 6 months before 
delivery determined no adverse events after vaccination among pregnant women and no difference in pregnancy outcomes 
compared with 826 pregnant women who were not vaccinated 
(<I>169</I>). During 2000<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2003, an estimated 2 million pregnant women 
were vaccinated, and only 20 adverse events among women who received TIV were reported to VAERS during this time, 
including nine injection-site reactions and eight systemic reactions (e.g., fever, headache, and myalgias). In addition, three 
miscarriages were reported, but these were not known to be causally related to vaccination 
(<I>207</I>). Similar results have been reported 
in certain smaller studies (<I>168,170,208</I>), and a recent international review of data on the safety of TIV concluded that 
no evidence exists to suggest harm to the fetus 
(<I>209</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Persons with Chronic Medical Conditions</B> </P>
		<P>In a randomized cross-over study of children and adults with asthma, no increase in asthma exacerbations was reported 
for either age group (<I>210</I>), and a second study indicated no 
increase in wheezing among vaccinated asthmatic children 
(<I>130</I>). One study (<I>123</I>) reported that 20%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>28% of children with asthma aged 9 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 years had local pain and swelling at the 
site of influenza vaccination, and another study 
(<I>113</I>) reported that 23% of children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 years with chronic heart 
or lung disease had local reactions. A blinded, randomized, cross-over study of 1,952 adults and children with 
asthma demonstrated that only self-reported &quot;body aches&quot; were reported more frequently after TIV (25%) than 
placebo-injection (21%) (<I>210</I>). However, a placebo-controlled trial of TIV indicated no difference in local reactions among 53 children aged 
6 months<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>6 years with high-risk medical conditions or among 305 healthy children aged 3<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>12 years (<I>114</I>).
</P>
		<P>Among children with high-risk medical conditions, one study of 52 children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>3 years reported fever 
among 27% and irritability and insomnia among 25% 
(<I>113</I>); and a study among 33 children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 months reported that 
one child had irritability and one had a fever and seizure after vaccination 
(<I>211</I>). No placebo comparison group was used in 
these studies.
</P>
		<P><B>Immunocompromised Persons</B> </P>
		<P>Data demonstrating safety of TIV for HIV-infected persons are limited, but no evidence exists that vaccination has 
a clinically important impact on HIV infection or immunocompetence. One study demonstrated a transient (i.e., 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 week) increase in HIV RNA (ribonucleic acid) levels in one HIV-infected person after influenza virus infection 
(<I>212</I>). Studies have demonstrated a transient increase in replication of HIV-1 in the plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 
HIV-infected persons after vaccine administration 
(<I>159,213</I>). However, more recent and better-designed studies have not documented 
a substantial increase in the replication of HIV 
(<I>214<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>217</I>). CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts or progression of HIV disease 
have not been demonstrated to change substantially after influenza vaccination among HIV-infected persons compared 
with unvaccinated HIV-infected persons 
(<I>159,218</I>). Limited information is available about the effect of antiretroviral therapy 
on increases in HIV RNA levels after either natural influenza virus infection or influenza vaccination 
(<I>73,219</I>).
</P>
		<P>Data are similarly limited for persons with other immunocompromising conditions. In small studies, vaccination did 
not affect allograft function or cause rejection episodes in 
recipients of kidney transplants (<I>162,164</I>), heart transplants 
(<I>163</I>), or liver transplants (<I>165</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Hypersensitivity</B> </P>
		<P>Immediate and presumably allergic reactions (e.g., hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, and systemic 
anaphylaxis) occur rarely after influenza vaccination 
(<I>220,221</I>). These reactions probably result from hypersensitivity to certain 
vaccine components; the majority of reactions probably are caused by residual egg protein. Although influenza vaccines contain only 
a limited quantity of egg protein, this protein can induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions among persons who have 
severe egg allergy. Manufacturers use a variety of different compounds to inactivate influenza viruses and add antibiotics to 
prevent bacterial contamination. Package inserts should be consulted for additional information.
		</P>
		<P>Persons who have had hives or swelling of the lips or tongue, or who have experienced acute respiratory distress or 
who collapse after eating eggs, should consult a physician for 
appropriate evaluation to help determine if vaccine should 
be administered. Persons who have documented immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to eggs, including those 
who have had occupational asthma related to egg exposure or other allergic responses to egg protein, also might be at 
increased risk for allergic reactions to influenza vaccine, and consultation with a physician before vaccination should be considered 
(<I>222<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>224</I>).
</P>
		<P>Hypersensitivity reactions to other vaccine components can occur but are rare. Although exposure to vaccines 
containing thimerosal can lead to hypersensitivity, the majority of 
patients do not have reactions to thimerosal when it is administered 
as a component of vaccines, even when patch or intradermal tests for thimerosal indicate hypersensitivity 
(<I>225,226</I>). When reported, hypersensitivity to thimerosal typically has consisted of local delayed hypersensitivity reactions 
(<I>225</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome and TIV</B> </P>
		<P>The annual incidence of Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome (GBS) is 10<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>20 cases per 1 million adults 
(<I>227</I>). Substantial evidence exists that multiple infectious illnesses, most notably 
		<I>Campylobacter jejuni </I>gastrointestinal infections and upper 
respiratory tract infections, are associated with GBS 
(<I>228<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>230</I>). The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with 
an increased frequency of GBS (<I>231,232</I>), estimated at one 
additional case of GBS per 100,000 persons vaccinated. The risk 
for influenza vaccine-associated GBS was higher among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>25 years than among persons aged &lt;25 years 
(<I>233</I>). However, obtaining strong epidemiologic evidence for a possible small increase in risk for a rare condition with 
multiple causes is difficult, and no evidence exists for a consistent causal relation between subsequent vaccines prepared from 
other influenza viruses and GBS.
</P>
		<P>None of the studies conducted using influenza vaccines other than the 1976 swine influenza vaccine have demonstrated 
a substantial increase in GBS associated with influenza vaccines. During three of four influenza seasons studied during 1977<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1991, the overall relative risk estimates for GBS after influenza vaccination were not statistically significant in any of 
these studies (<I>234<FONT

COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>93 and 1993<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>94 seasons, the overall relative risk for GBS was 1.7 (CI 
= 1.0<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2.8; p = 0.04) during the 6 weeks after vaccination, representing approximately one additional case of GBS per 1 
million persons vaccinated; the combined number of GBS cases peaked 2 weeks after vaccination 
(<I>231</I>). Results of a study that examined health-care data from Ontario, Canada, during 1992<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2004 demonstrated a small but statistically 
significant temporal association between receiving influenza vaccination and subsequent hospital admission for GBS. However, 
no increase in cases of GBS at the population level was 
reported after introduction of a mass public influenza 
vaccination program in Ontario beginning in 2000 
(<I>237</I>). Data from VAERS have documented decreased reporting of GBS 
occurring after vaccination across age groups over time, 
despite overall increased reporting of other, non-GBS conditions occurring 
after administration of influenza vaccine 
(<I>203</I>). Cases of GBS after influenza virus infection have been 
reported, but no other epidemiologic studies have documented such an association 
(<I>238,239</I>). Recently published data from the United 
Kingdom's General Practice Research Database (GPRD) found influenza vaccine to be protective against GBS, although it is unclear 
if this was associated with protection against influenza or confounding because of a &quot;healthy vaccinee&quot; (e.g., healthier 
persons might be more likely to be vaccinated and are lower risk for GBS) 
(<I>240</I>). A separate GPRD analysis found no 
association between vaccination and GBS over a 9 year period; only three cases of GBS occurred within 6 weeks after influenza 
vaccine (<I>241</I>).
</P>
		<P>If GBS is a side effect of influenza vaccines other than 1976 swine influenza vaccine, the estimated risk for GBS (on 
the basis of the few studies that have demonstrated an association between vaccination and GBS) is low (i.e., approximately 
one additional case per 1 million persons vaccinated). The potential benefits of influenza vaccination in preventing serious 
illness, hospitalization, and death substantially outweigh these estimates of risk for vaccine-associated GBS. No evidence 
indicates that the case fatality ratio for GBS differs among vaccinated persons and those not vaccinated.
		</P>
		<P><B>Use of TIV among Patients with<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>a History of GBS</B> </P>
		<P>The incidence of GBS among the general population is low, but persons with a history of GBS have a substantially 
greater likelihood of subsequently experiencing GBS than persons without such a history 
(<I>227</I>). Thus, the likelihood of 
coincidentally experiencing GBS after influenza vaccination is 
expected to be greater among persons with a history of GBS than 
among persons with no history of this syndrome. Whether influenza vaccination specifically might increase the risk for recurrence 
of GBS is unknown. However, avoiding vaccinating persons who are not at high risk for severe influenza complications and 
who are known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks after a previous influenza vaccination might be prudent as a 
precaution. As an alternative, physicians might consider using influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis for these persons. Although data 
are limited, the established benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh the risks for many persons who have a history 
of GBS and who are also at high risk for severe complications from influenza.

		<P><B>Vaccine Preservative (Thimerosal)<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>in Multidose Vials of TIV</B> </P>
		<P>Thimerosal, a mercury-containing anti-bacterial compound, has been used as a preservative in vaccines since the 
1930s (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843a4.htm">242</a></I>) and is used in multidose vial preparations of TIV to reduce the likelihood of bacterial contamination. No 
scientific evidence indicates that thimerosal in vaccines, including influenza vaccines, is a cause of adverse events other 
than 

occasion local hypersensitivity reactions in vaccine recipients. In addition, no scientific evidence exists that 
thimerosal-containing vaccines are a cause of adverse events among children born to women who received vaccine during 
pregnancy. Evidence is accumulating that supports the absence of substantial risk for neurodevelopment disorders or other harm 
resulting from exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines 
(<I>243<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>250</I>). However, continuing public concern about exposure to 
mercury in vaccines was viewed as a potential barrier to achieving higher vaccine coverage levels and reducing the burden of 
vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the U.S. Public Health Service and other organizations recommended that efforts be made 
to eliminate or reduce the thimerosal content in vaccines as part of a strategy to reduce mercury exposures from all 
sources (<I>243,245,247</I>). Since mid-2001, vaccines routinely recommended for infants aged &lt;6 months in the United States have 
been manufactured either without or with greatly reduced (trace) amounts of thimerosal. As a result, a substantial reduction in 
the total mercury exposure from vaccines for infants and children already has been achieved 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5515a1.htm">197</a></I>). ACIP and other federal agencies and professional medical organizations continue to support efforts to provide thimerosal preservative<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>free vaccine options.
</P>
		<P>The benefits of influenza vaccination for all recommended groups, including pregnant women and young 
children, outweigh concerns on the basis of a theoretical risk from thimerosal exposure through vaccination. The risks for severe 
illness from influenza virus infection are elevated among both young children and pregnant women, and vaccination has 
been demonstrated to reduce the risk for severe influenza illness and subsequent medical complications. In contrast, no 
scientifically conclusive evidence has demonstrated harm from exposure to vaccine containing thimerosal preservative. For these 
reasons, persons recommended to receive TIV may receive any age- and risk factor<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>appropriate vaccine preparation, 
depending on availability. An analysis of VAERS reports found no difference in the safety profile of preservative-containing compared 
with preservative-free TIV vaccines in infants aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months (<I>202</I>).
</P>
		<P>Nonetheless, certain states have enacted legislation banning the administration of vaccines containing mercury; 
the provisions defining mercury content vary 
(<I>251</I>). LAIV and many of the single dose vial or syringe preparations of TIV 
are thimerosal-free, and the number of influenza vaccine doses that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative is expected 
to increase (<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). However, these laws might present a barrier to vaccination unless influenza vaccines that do not 
contain thimerosal as a preservative are easily available in those states.
</P>
		<P>The U.S. vaccine supply for infants and pregnant women is in a period of transition during which the availability 
of thimerosal-reduced or thimerosal-free vaccine intended for these groups is being expanded by manufacturers as a 
feasible means of further reducing an infant's cumulative exposure to mercury. Other environmental sources of mercury exposure 
are more difficult or impossible to avoid or eliminate 
(<I>243</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>LAIV Dosage, Administration,<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>and Storage</B> </P>
		<P>Each dose of LAIV contains the same three vaccine antigens used in TIV. However, the antigens are constituted as 
live, attenuated, cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive vaccine viruses. Additional components of LAIV include egg allantoic 
fluid, monosodium glutamate, sucrose, phosphate, and glutamate buffer; and hydrolyzed porcine gelatin. LAIV does not 
contain thimerosal. LAIV is made from attenuated viruses 
that are only able to replicate efficiently at temperatures present in the 
nasal mucosa. LAIV does not cause systemic symptoms of influenza in vaccine recipients, although a minority of 
recipients experience nasal congestion, which is probably a result of either effects of intranasal vaccine administration or local 
viral replication or fever (<I>252</I>).
</P>
		<P>LAIV is intended for intranasal administration only and should not be administered by the intramuscular, intradermal, 
or intravenous route. LAIV is not licensed for vaccination of children aged &lt;2 years or adults aged &gt;49 years. LAIV is supplied 
in a prefilled, single-use sprayer containing 0.2 mL 
of vaccine. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e., half of the total sprayer contents) 
is sprayed into the first nostril while the recipient is in the upright position. An attached 
dose-divider clip is removed from the sprayer to administer the second half of the dose into the other nostril. LAIV is shipped to end users at 35&#176;F<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>46&#176;F (2&#176;C<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8&#176;C). LAIV should be stored at 35&#176;F<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>46&#176;F (2&#176;C<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8&#176;C) on receipt and can remain at that temperature until the 
expiration date is reached (<I>252</I>). Vaccine prepared for a previous influenza season should not be administered to provide protection 
for any subsequent season.
</P>
		<P><B>Shedding, Transmission, and Stability of Vaccine Viruses</B> </P>
		<P>Available data indicate that both children and adults vaccinated with LAIV can shed vaccine viruses after 
vaccination, although in lower amounts than occur typically with shedding of wild-type influenza viruses. In rare instances, shed 
vaccine viruses can be transmitted from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated persons. However, serious illnesses have not been 
reported among unvaccinated persons who have been infected inadvertently with vaccine viruses.
		</P>
		<P>One study of children aged 8<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>36 months in a child care center assessed transmissibility of vaccine viruses from 
98 vaccinated to 99 unvaccinated subjects; 80% of vaccine recipients shed one or more virus strains (mean duration: 7.6 
days). One influenza type B vaccine strain isolate was recovered from a placebo recipient and was confirmed to be vaccine-type 
virus. The type B isolate retained the cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive, attenuated phenotype, and it possessed the same 
genetic sequence as a virus shed from a vaccine recipient who was in the same play group. The placebo recipient from whom 
the influenza type B vaccine strain was isolated had symptoms of a mild upper respiratory illness but did not experience 
any serious clinical events. The estimated probability of acquiring vaccine virus after close contact with a single LAIV recipient 
in this child care population was 0.6%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2.4% (<I>253</I>).
</P>
		<P>Studies assessing whether vaccine viruses are shed have been based on viral cultures or PCR detection of vaccine viruses 
in nasal aspirates from persons who have received LAIV. One study of 20 healthy vaccinated adults aged 18<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years demonstrated that the majority of shedding occurred within the first 3 days after vaccination, although the vaccine virus 
was detected in one subject on day 7 after vaccine receipt. Duration or type of symptoms associated with receipt of LAIV did 
not correlate with detection of vaccine viruses in nasal aspirates 
(<I>254</I>). Another study in 14 healthy adults aged 18<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years indicated that 50% of these adults had viral antigen 
detected by direct immunofluorescence or rapid antigen tests within 
7 days of vaccination. The majority of samples with detectable virus were collected on day 2 or 3 
(<I>255</I>). Vaccine strain virus was detected from nasal secretions in one (2%) of 57 HIV-infected adults who received LAIV, none of 54 
HIV-negative participants (<I>256</I>), and three (13%) of 23 
HIV-infected children compared with seven (28%) of 25 children who were 
not HIV-infected (<I>257</I>). No participants in these studies had detectable virus beyond 10 days after receipt of LAIV. The 
possibility of person-to-person transmission of vaccine viruses was not assessed in these studies 
(<I>254<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>257</I>).
</P>
		<P>In clinical trials, viruses isolated from vaccine recipients have been phenotypically stable. In one study, nasal and throat 
swab specimens were collected from 17 study participants for 2 weeks after vaccine receipt 
(<I>258</I>). Virus isolates were analyzed by multiple genetic techniques. All isolates retained the LAIV genotype after replication in the human host, and all retained 
the cold-adapted and temperature-sensitive phenotypes. A study conducted in a child-care setting demonstrated that 
limited genetic change occurred in the LAIV strains following replication in the vaccine recipients 
(<I>259</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Immunogenicity, Efficacy,<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>and Effectiveness of LAIV</B> </P>
		<P>LAIV virus strains replicate primarily in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. The protective mechanisms induced by 
vaccination with LAIV are not understood completely but appear to involve both serum and nasal secretory antibodies. 
The immunogenicity of the approved LAIV has been assessed in multiple studies conducted among children and adults 
(<I>106,260<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>266</I>). No single laboratory measurement closely correlates with protective immunity induced by LAIV 
(<I>261</I>).

		<P>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 1,602 healthy children aged 15<FONT

children aged 60<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>71 months who received 2 doses in the first season. In season one (1996<FONT

virus strains were well-matched, efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza was 94% for participants who received 2 doses 
of LAIV separated by <U>&gt;</U>6 weeks, and 89% for those who received 1 dose. In season two, when the A (H3N2) component in 
the vaccine was not well-matched with circulating virus strains, efficacy (1 dose) was 86%, for an overall efficacy over 
two influenza seasons of 92%. Receipt of LAIV also resulted in 21% fewer febrile illnesses and a significant decrease in acute 
otitis media requiring antibiotics (<I>267,269</I>). Other randomized, placebo-controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of LAIV 
in young children against culture-confirmed influenza include a study conducted among children aged 6<FONT

(<I>270</I>), in which 85%<FONT

upper respiratory tract illnesses (24% reduction), and significant reductions in days of illness, days of work lost, days 
with health-care<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>provider visits, and use of prescription antibiotics and over-the-counter medications 
(<I>273</I>). Efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza in a randomized, placebo-controlled

</P>
		<P><B>Comparisons of LAIV and TIV Efficacy or Effectiveness</B> </P>
		<P>Both TIV and LAIV have been demonstrated to be effective in children and adults, but data directly comparing the 
efficacy or effectiveness of these two types of influenza vaccines are limited. Studies comparing the efficacy of TIV to that of 
LAIV have been conducted in a variety of settings and populations using several different outcomes. One randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge study among 92 healthy adults aged 18<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>41 years assessed the efficacy of both LAIV and TIV 
in preventing influenza infection when challenged with wild-type strains that were antigenically similar to vaccine strains 
(<I>282</I>). The overall efficacy in preventing laboratory-documented influenza from all three influenza strains combined was 85% 
and 71%, respectively, when challenged 28 days after vaccination by viruses to which study participants were susceptible 
before vaccination. The difference in efficacy between the two vaccines was not statistically significant in this limited study. 
No additional challenges to assess efficacy at time points later than 28 days were conducted. In a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted among young adults during an influenza season when the majority of circulating 
H3N2 viruses were antigenically drifted from that season's vaccine viruses, the efficacy of LAIV and TIV against 
culture-confirmed influenza was 57% and 77%, respectively. The difference in efficacy was not statistically significant and was based largely on 
a difference in efficacy against influenza B 
(<I>155</I>).
</P>
		<P>A randomized controlled clinical trial conducted among children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>71 months during the 2004<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>05 influenza season demonstrated a 55% reduction in cases of 
culture-confirmed influenza among children who received LAIV compared 
with those who received TIV (<I>277</I>). In this study, LAIV efficacy was higher compared with TIV against antigenically drifted 
viruses as well as well-matched viruses 
(<I>277</I>). An open-label, nonrandomized, community-based influenza vaccine trial 
conducted during an influenza season when circulating H3N2 strains were poorly matched with strains contained in the vaccine 
also indicated that LAIV, but not TIV, was effective against antigenically drifted H3N2 strains during that influenza season. In 
this study, children aged 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 years who received LAIV had significant protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza 
(37%) and pneumonia and influenza events (50%) 
(<I>278</I>).
</P>
		<P>Although LAIV is not licensed for use in persons with risk factors for influenza complications, certain studies 
have compared the efficacy of LAIV to TIV in these groups. LAIV provided 32% increased protection in preventing 
culture-confirmed influenza compared with TIV in one study conducted among children aged

</P>
		<P><B>Effectiveness of Vaccination for Decreasing Transmission to Contacts</B>
		</P>
		<P>Decreasing transmission of influenza from caregivers and household contacts to persons at high risk might reduce ILI 
and complications among persons at high risk. Influenza 
virus infection and ILI are common among HCP (<I>285<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>287</I>). Influenza outbreaks have been attributed to low vaccination rates among HCP in hospitals and long-term<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>care facilities (<I>288<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>290</I>). One serosurvey demonstrated that 23% of HCP had serologic evidence of influenza virus infection during a single 
influenza season; the majority had mild illness or subclinical infection 
(<I>285</I>). Observational studies have demonstrated that 
vaccination of HCP is associated with decreased deaths among nursing home patients 
(<I>291,292</I>). In one cluster-randomized 
controlled trial that included 2,604 residents of 44 nursing homes, significant decreases in mortality, ILI, and medical visits for ILI 
care were demonstrated among residents in nursing homes in which staff were offered influenza vaccination (coverage rate: 
48%), compared with nursing homes in which staff were not provided with vaccination (coverage rate: 6%) 
(<I>293</I>). A review concluded that vaccination of HCP in settings in which patients were also vaccinated provided significant reductions in 
deaths among elderly patients from all causes and deaths from pneumonia 
(<I>294</I>).
</P>
		<P>Epidemiologic studies of community outbreaks of influenza demonstrate that school-age children typically have the 
highest influenza illness attack rates, suggesting routine universal vaccination of children might reduce transmission to their 
household contacts and possibly others in the community. Results from certain studies have indicated that the benefits of 
vaccinating children might extend to protection of their adult contacts and to persons at risk for influenza complications in 
the community. However, these data are limited and studies have not used laboratory-confirmed influenza as an outcome 
measure. A single-blinded, randomized controlled study conducted during as part of a 1996<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1997 vaccine effectiveness 
study demonstrated that vaccinating preschool-aged children with TIV reduced influenza-related morbidity among some 
household contacts (<I>295</I>). A randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial among children with recurrent respiratory tract 
infections demonstrated that members of families with children who had received LAIV were significantly less likely to have 
respiratory tract infections and reported significantly fewer workdays lost, compared with families with children who 
received placebo (<I>296</I>). In nonrandomized community-based studies, administration of LAIV has been demonstrated to reduce 
MAARI (<I>297,298</I>) and ILI-related economic and medical consequences (e.g., workdays lost and number of health-care provider 
visits) among contacts of vaccine recipients 
(<I>298</I>). Households with children attending schools in which school-based 
LAIV vaccination programs had been established reported 
less ILI and fewer physician visits during peak influenza season, 
compared with households with children in schools in which no LAIV vaccination had been offered. However a decrease in the overall 
rate of school absenteeism was not reported in communities in which LAIV vaccination was offered 
(<I>298</I>). These community-based studies have not used laboratory-confirmed influenza as an outcome.
		</P>
		<P>Some studies have also documented reductions in influenza illness among persons living in communities where 
focused programs for vaccinating children have been conducted. A community-based observational study conducted during the 
1968 pandemic using a univalent inactivated vaccine reported that a vaccination program targeting school-aged children 
(coverage rate: 86%) in one community reduced influenza rates within the community among all age groups compared with 
another community in which aggressive vaccination was not conducted among school-aged children 
(<I>299</I>). An observational study conducted in Russia demonstrated reductions in ILI among the community-dwelling elderly after implementation of 
a vaccination program using TIV for children aged 3<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>6 years (57% coverage achieved) and children and adolescents aged 7<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>17 years (72% coverage achieved) 
(<I>300</I>). In a nonrandomized community-based study conducted over three  influenza 
seasons, 8%<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18% reductions in the incidence of MAARI during the influenza season among adults aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>35 years were observed in communities in which LAIV was 
offered to all children aged <U>&gt;</U>18 months (estimated coverage rate: 20%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>25%) compared with communities with such vaccination programs 
(<I>297</I>). In a subsequent influenza season, the same 
investigators documented a 9% reduction in MAARI rates during the influenza season among persons aged 35<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>44 years in intervention communities, where coverage was estimated at 31% among school children, compared with control communities. 
However, MAARI rates among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>45 years were lower in the intervention communities regardless of the presence 
of influenza in the community, suggesting that lower rates could not be attributed to vaccination of school children 
against influenza (<I>301</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccination when Circulating Influenza Virus 
Strains Differ from Vaccine Strains</B> </P>
		<P>Manufacturing trivalent influenza virus vaccines is a challenging process that takes 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 months to complete. 
This manufacturing timeframe requires that influenza vaccine strains for influenza vaccines used in the United States must 
be selected in February of each year by the FDA to allow time for manufacturers to prepare vaccines for the next influenza 
season. Vaccine strain selections are based on global viral surveillance data that is used to identify trends in antigenic changes 
among circulating influenza viruses and the availability of suitable vaccine virus candidates.
		</P>
		<P>Vaccination can provide reduced but substantial 
cross-protection against drifted strains in some seasons, 
including reductions in severe outcomes such as hospitalization. Usually one or more circulating viruses with antigenic 
changes compared with the vaccine strains are identified in each influenza season. However, assessment of the clinical effectiveness 
of influenza vaccines cannot be determined solely by laboratory evaluation of the degree of antigenic match between vaccine 
and circulating strains. In some influenza seasons, circulating influenza viruses with significant antigenic differences 
predominate and, compared with seasons when vaccine and circulating strains are well-matched, reductions in vaccine effectiveness 
are sometimes observed (<I>126,139,145<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">, </FONT>147,191</I>). However, even during years when vaccine strains were not antigenically 
well matched to circulating strains, substantial protection has been observed against severe outcomes, presumably because 
of vaccine-induced cross-reacting antibodies 
(<I>139,145,147,273</I>). For example, in one study conducted during an 
influenza season (2003<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>04) when the predominant circulating strain was an influenza A (H3N2) virus that was antigenically 
different from that season's vaccine strain, effectiveness among persons aged 50<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years against laboratory-confirmed influenza 
illness was 60% among healthy persons and 48% among persons with medical conditions that increase risk for 
influenza complications (<I>147</I>). An interim, within-season analysis during the 2007<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 influenza season indicated that 
vaccine effectiveness was 44% overall, 54% among healthy persons aged 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years, and 58% against influenza A, despite the 
finding that viruses circulating in the study area were predominately a drifted influenza A H3N2 and a influenza B strain from 
a different lineage compared with vaccine strains 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5715a1.htm">302</a></I>). Among children, both TIV and LAIV provide protection 
against infection even in seasons when vaccines and circulating strains are not well matched. Vaccine effectiveness against ILI 
was 49%<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>69% in two observational studies, and 49% against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza in a 
case-control study conducted among young children during the 2003<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>04 influenza season, when a drifted influenza A 
H3N2 strain predominated, based on viral surveillance data 
(<I>121,125</I>). However, continued improvements in 
collecting representative circulating viruses and use surveillance data to forecast antigenic drift are needed. Shortening 
manufacturing time to increase the time to identify good vaccine candidate strains from among the most 
recent circulating strains also is important. Data from multiple seasons and collected in a consistent manner are needed to better understand 
vaccine effectiveness during seasons when circulating and vaccine virus strains are not well-matched.
		</P>
		<P><B>Cost-Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccination</B> </P>
		<P>Economic studies of influenza vaccination are difficult to compare because they have used different measures of both 
costs and benefits (e.g., cost-only, cost-effectiveness, 
cost-benefit, or cost-utility). However, most studies find that 
vaccination reduces or minimizes health care, societal, and individual costs, or the productivity losses and absenteeism associated 
with influenza illness. One national study estimated the annual economic burden of seasonal influenza in the United 
States (using 2003 population and dollars) to be $87.1 billion, including $10.4 billion in direct medical costs 
(<I>303</I>).
</P>
		<P>Studies of influenza vaccination in the United States among persons aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>65 years have documented substantial 
reductions in hospitalizations and deaths and overall societal cost savings 
(<I>186,187</I>). Studies comparing adults in different age groups 
also find that vaccination is economically beneficial. One study that compared the economic impact of vaccination among 
persons aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years with those aged 15<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years indicated that vaccination resulted in a net savings per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) and that the Medicare program saved costs of treating illness by paying for vaccination 
(<I>304</I>). A study of a larger population comparing persons aged 50<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years with those aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years estimated the cost-effectiveness of 
influenza vaccination to be $28,000 per QALY saved (in 2000 dollars) in persons aged 50<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years compared with $980 per 
QALY saved among persons aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years 
(<I>305</I>).
</P>
		<P>Economic analyses among adults aged &lt;65 years have 
reported mixed results regarding influenza vaccination. Two studies 
in the United States found that vaccination can reduce 
both direct medical costs and indirect costs from work absenteeism 
and 

reduced productivity (<I>306,307</I>). However, another United States study indicated no productivity and absentee savings in 
a strategy to vaccinate healthy working adults, although vaccination was still estimated to be cost-effective 
(<I>139</I>).
</P>
		<P>Cost analyses have documented the considerable cost burden of illness among children. In a study of 727 children at 
a medical center during 2000<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2004, the mean total cost of hospitalization for influenza-related illness was $13,159 
($39,792 for patients admitted to an intensive care unit and $7,030 for patients cared for exclusively on the wards) 
(<I>308</I>). Strategies that focus on vaccinating children with medical conditions that confer a higher risk for influenza complications are more 
cost-effective than a strategy of vaccinating all children 
(<I>309</I>). An analysis that compared the costs of vaccinating children 
of varying ages with TIV and LAIV indicated that costs per QALY saved increased with age for both vaccines. In 2003 dollars 
per QALY saved, costs for routine vaccination using TIV were $12,000 for healthy children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months and $119,000 
for healthy adolescents aged 12<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>17 years, compared with $9,000 and $109,000 using LAIV, respectively 
(<I>310</I>). Economic evaluations of vaccinating children have demonstrated a wide range of cost estimates, but have generally found this strategy 
to be either cost-saving or cost-beneficial (<I>311<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>314</I>).
</P>
		<P>Economic analyses are sensitive to the vaccination venue, with vaccination in medical care settings incurring 
higher projected costs. In a published model, the mean cost (year 2004 values) of vaccination was lower in mass vaccination 
($17.04) and pharmacy ($11.57) settings than in scheduled doctor's office visits ($28.67) 
(<I>315</I>). Vaccination in nonmedical settings 
was projected to be cost saving for healthy adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 years and for high-risk adults of all ages. For healthy adults aged 18<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years, preventing an episode of influenza would cost $90 if vaccination were delivered in a pharmacy setting, $210 in a 
mass vaccination setting, and $870 during a scheduled doctor's office visit 
(<I>315</I>). Medicare payment rates in recent years have 
been less than the costs associated with providing vaccination in a medical practice 
(<I>316</I>).
</P>
		<P><B>Vaccination Coverage Levels</B> </P>
		<P>Continued annual monitoring is needed to determine the effects on vaccination coverage of vaccine supply delays 
and shortages, changes in influenza vaccination recommendations and target groups for vaccination, reimbursement rates 
for vaccine and vaccine administration, and other factors related to vaccination coverage among adults and children. One of 
the national health objectives for 2010 includes achieving an influenza vaccination coverage level of 90% for persons aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>65 years and among nursing home residents 
(<I>317,318</I>); new strategies to improve coverage are needed to achieve these 
objectives (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5405a1.htm">319</a>,320</I>). Increasing vaccination coverage among persons who have high-risk conditions and are aged &lt;65 years, 
including children at high risk, is the highest priority for 
expanding influenza vaccine use.
</P>
		<P>On the basis of the 2006 final data set and the 2007 early release data from the National Health Interview Survey 
(NHIS), estimated national influenza vaccine coverage during the 2005<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>06 and 2006<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>07 influenza seasons among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years and 50<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>64 years increased slightly from 32% and 65%, respectively to 36% and 66% 
(<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab3">Table 3</a>) and appear to be approaching coverage levels observed before the 2004<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>05 vaccine shortage year. In 2005<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>06 and 2006<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>07, estimated vaccination coverage levels among adults with high-risk conditions aged 18<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years were 23% and 26%, 
respectively, substantially lower than the <I>Healthy People 2000 
</I>and <I>Healthy People 2010 </I>objectives of 60% (<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab3">Table 3</a>) 
(<I>317,318</I>).
</P>
		<P>Opportunities to vaccinate persons at risk for influenza complications (e.g., during hospitalizations for other 
causes) often are missed. In a study of hospitalized Medicare patients, only 31.6% were vaccinated before admission, 1.9% 
during admission, and 10.6% after admission 
(<I>321</I>). A study in New York City during 2001<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2005 among 7,063 children 
aged 6<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months indicated that 2-dose vaccine coverage increased from 1.6% to 23.7%. Although the average number of 
medical visits during which an opportunity to be vaccinated 
decreased during the course of the study from 2.9 to 2.0 per child, 
55% of all visits during the final year of the study still represented a missed vaccination opportunity 
(<I>322</I>). Using standing orders in hospitals increases vaccination rates among hospitalized persons 
(<I>323</I>). In one survey, the strongest predictor of 
receiving vaccination was the survey respondent's belief that he or she was in a high-risk group. However, many persons in 
high-risk groups did not know that they were in a group recommended for vaccination 
(<I>324</I>).
</P>
		<P>Reducing racial and ethnic health disparities, including disparities in influenza vaccination coverage, is an 
overarching national goal that is not being met 
(<I>317</I>). Estimated vaccination coverage levels in 2007 among persons aged 
		<U>&gt;</U>65 years were 70% for non-Hispanic whites, 58% for non-Hispanic blacks, and 54% for Hispanics 
(<I>325</I>). Among Medicare beneficiaries, other key factors that contribute to disparities in coverage include variations in the propensity of patients to actively 
seek vaccination and variations in the likelihood that providers recommend vaccination 
(<I>326,327</I>). One study estimated that 

eliminating these disparities in vaccination coverage would have an impact on mortality similar to the impact of 
eliminating deaths attributable to kidney disease among blacks or liver disease among Hispanics 
(<I>328</I>).
</P>
		<P>Reported vaccination levels are low among children at 
increased risk for influenza complications. Coverage among 
children aged 2<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>17 years with asthma for the 2004<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>05 influenza season was estimated to be 29% 
(<I><a href="mm5609a2.htm">329</a></I>). One study reported 79% vaccination coverage among children attending a cystic fibrosis treatment center 
(<I>330</I>). During the first season for which ACIP recommended that all children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months receive vaccination, 33% received one or more dose 
of influenza vaccination, and 18% received 2 doses if they were unvaccinated previously 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5539a1.htm">331</a></I>). Among children enrolled in HMOs who had received a first dose during 2001<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2004, second dose coverage varied from 29% to 44% among children 
aged 6<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months and from 12% to 24% among children aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 years (<I>332</I>). A rapid analysis of influenza vaccination 
coverage levels among members of an HMO in Northern California demonstrated that during 2004<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2005, the first year of 
the recommendation for vaccination of children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months, 1-dose coverage was 57% 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5427a2.htm">333</a></I>). During the 2005<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>06 influenza season, the second season for which ACIP recommended that all children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months receive vaccination, coverage remained low and did not increase substantially from the 2004<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>05 season. Data collected in 2006 
by the National Immunization Survey indicated that for the 2005<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>06 season, 32% of children aged 
6<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months received 
at least 1 dose of influenza vaccine and 21% were fully vaccinated (i.e., received 1 or 2 doses depending on previous 
vaccination history); however, results varied substantially among states 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5637a2.htm">334</a></I>). As has been reported for older adults, a 
physician recommendation for vaccination and the perception that having a child be vaccinated &quot;is a smart idea&quot; were 
associated positively with likelihood of vaccination of children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months (<I>335</I>). Similarly, children with asthma were 
more likely to be vaccinated if their parents recalled 
a physician recommendation to be vaccinated or believed 
that the vaccine worked well (<I>336</I>). Implementation of a reminder/recall system in a pediatric clinic increased the percentage of children 
with asthma or reactive airways disease receiving vaccination from 5% to 32% 
(<I>337</I>).
</P>
		<P>Although annual vaccination is recommended for HCP and is a high priority for reducing morbidity associated 
with influenza in health-care settings and for expanding influenza vaccine use 
(<I>338<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT><a href="rr5502a1.htm">340</a></I>), national survey data demonstrated 
a vaccination coverage level of only 42% among HCP during the 2005<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>06 season (<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab3">Table 3</a>). Vaccination of HCP has 
been associated with reduced work absenteeism 
(<I>286</I>) and with fewer deaths among nursing home patients 
(<I>292,293</I>) and elderly hospitalized patients 
(<I>294</I>). Factors associated with a higher rate of influenza vaccination among HCP include older age, 
being a hospital employee, having employer provided health-care insurance, having had pneumococcal or hepatitis B vaccination 
in the past, or having visited a health-care professional during the preceding year. Non-Hispanic black HCP were less likely 
than non-Hispanic white HCP to be vaccinated 
(<I>341</I>). Beliefs that are frequently cited by HCP who decline vaccination 
include doubts about the risk for influenza and the need for vaccination, concerns about vaccine effectiveness and side effects, 
and dislike of injections (<I>342</I>).
</P>
		<P>Vaccine coverage among pregnant women has not increased significantly during the preceding decade. 
(<I>343</I>). Only 12% and 13% of pregnant women participating in the 2006 and 2007 NHIS reported vaccination during the 2005<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>06 and 2006<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>07 seasons, respectively, excluding pregnant women who reported diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and other 
selected high-risk conditions (<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab3">Table 3</a>). In a study of influenza vaccine acceptance by pregnant women, 71% of those who were offered 
the vaccine chose to be vaccinated (<I>344</I>). However, a 1999 survey of obstetricians and gynecologists 
determined that only 39% administered influenza vaccine to obstetric patients in their practices, although 86% agreed that pregnant women's risk 
for influenza-related morbidity and mortality increases during the last two trimesters 
(<I>345</I>).
</P>
		<P>Influenza vaccination coverage in all groups recommended for vaccination remains suboptimal. Despite the timing of 
the peak of influenza disease, administration of vaccine decreases substantially after November. According to results from 
the NHIS regarding the two most recent influenza seasons for which these data are available, approximately 84% of 
all influenza vaccination were administered during September<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>November. Among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years, the percentage of September<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>November vaccinations was 92% 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5646a3.htm">346</a></I>). Because many persons recommended for vaccination 
remain unvaccinated at the end of November, CDC encourages public health partners and health-care providers to 
conduct vaccination clinics and other activities that promote influenza vaccination annually during National Influenza 
Vaccination Week and throughout the remainder of the influenza season.
</P>
		<P>Self-report of influenza vaccination among adults, compared with determining vaccination status from the medical record, 
is a sensitive and specific source of information 
(<I>347</I>). Patient self-reports should be accepted as evidence of 
influenza 

vaccination in clinical practice (<I>347</I>). However, information on the validity of parents' reports of pediatric

</h3><P>Children Aged 6 Months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 Years</B>
</P><P>Beginning with the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 influenza season, all children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 years should be vaccinated against 
influenza annually. The expansion of vaccination to include all children aged 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 years should begin in 2008 if feasible, but no 
later than the 2009<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>10 influenza season. In 2004, ACIP recommended routine vaccination for all children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>23 months, and in 2006, ACIP expanded the recommendation to include all children aged 24<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>59 months. The committee's 
recommendation to expand routine influenza vaccination to include all school-age children and adolescents aged 5<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 years is based on 1) accumulated evidence that influenza vaccine is effective and safe for school-aged children (see &quot;Influenza 
Vaccine Efficacy, Effectiveness, and Safety&quot;), 2) increased 
evidence that influenza has substantial adverse impacts among school-aged 
children and their contacts (e.g., school absenteeism, increased antibiotic use, medical care visits, and 
parental work loss) (see &quot;Health-Care Use, Hospitalizations, and Deaths Attributed to Influenza&quot;), and, 3) an expectation that a simplified age-based 
influenza vaccine recommendation for all school-age children and adolescents will improve vaccine coverage levels among 
the approximately 50% of school-aged children who already had a risk- or contact-based indication for annual 
influenza vaccination.
</P><P>Children typically have the highest attack rates during community outbreaks of influenza and serve as a major source 
of transmission within communities (<I>1,2</I>). If sufficient vaccination coverage among children can be achieved, evidence 
for additional benefits, such as the indirect effect of reducing 
influenza among persons who have close contact with children 
and reducing overall transmission within communities, might occur. Achieving and sustaining community-level 
reductions in influenza will require mobilization of community resources and development of sustainable annual vaccination campaigns 
to assist health-care providers and vaccination programs in providing influenza vaccination services to children of all ages. 
In many areas, innovative community-based efforts, which might include mass vaccination programs in school or 
other community settings, will be needed to supplement vaccination services provided in health-care providers' offices or 
public health clinics. In nonrandomized community-based controlled trials, reductions in ILI-related symptoms and medical 
visits 

among household contacts have been demonstrated in communities where vaccination programs among school-aged 
children were established, compared with communities without such vaccination programs 
(<I>299<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>301</I>). Rates of school 
absences associated with ILI also were significantly reduced in some studies. In addition, reducing influenza transmission 
among children through vaccination has reduced rates for self-reported ILI among household contacts and among 
unvaccinated children (<I>297,298</I>).
</P><P>Reducing influenza-related illness among children who are at high risk for influenza complications should continue to be 
a primary focus of influenza-prevention efforts. Children who should be vaccinated because they are at high risk for 
influenza complications include all children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>59 months, children with certain medical conditions, children who are contacts 
of children aged &lt;5 years (60 months) or persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 years, and children who are contacts of persons at high risk 
for influenza complications because of medical conditions. Influenza vaccines are not licensed by FDA for use among 
children aged &lt;6 months. Because these infants are at higher risk for influenza complications compared with other child age 
groups, prevention efforts that focus on vaccinating household contacts and out-of-home caregivers to reduce the risk for influenza 
in these infants is a high priority.
</P><P>All children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 years who have not received vaccination against influenza previously should receive 2 doses 
of vaccine the first influenza season that they are vaccinated. The second dose should be administered 4 or more weeks after 
the initial dose. For example, children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 years who were vaccinated for the first time during the 
2007<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 influenza season but only received 1 dose during that season should receive 2 doses of the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 influenza vaccine. All other children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 years who have previously received 1 or more doses of influenza vaccine at any time 
should receive 1 dose of the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 influenza vaccine. Children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 years who only received a single 
vaccination during a season before 2007<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 should receive 1 dose of the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 influenza vaccine. If possible, both doses should 
be administered before onset of influenza season. However, vaccination, including the second dose, is recommended even 
after influenza virus begins to circulate in a community.
</P><P><B>HCP and Other Persons Who Can Transmit Influenza to Those<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>at High Risk</B>
</P><P>Healthy persons who are infected with influenza virus, 
including those with subclinical infection, can transmit 
influenza virus to persons at higher risk for complications from influenza. In addition to HCP, groups that can transmit 
influenza to high-risk persons and that should be vaccinated include
<ul>
<LI> employees of assisted living and other residences for persons in groups at high risk;
</LI><LI> persons who provide home care to persons in groups at high risk; and
</LI><LI> household contacts (including children) of persons in groups at high risk.
</ul>
<P>In addition, because children aged &lt;5 years are at increased risk for influenza-related hospitalization 
(<I>7,37,58,63,348</I>) compared with older children, vaccination is recommended for their household contacts and out-of-home 
caregivers. Because influenza vaccines have not been licensed by FDA for use among children aged &lt;6 months, emphasis should be 
placed on vaccinating contacts of children aged &lt;6 months. When vaccine supply is limited, priority for vaccination should be 
given to contacts of children aged &lt;6 months.
</P><P>Healthy HCP and persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years who are contacts of persons in these groups and who are not contacts of 
severely immunosuppressed persons (see Close Contacts of Immunocompromised Persons) should receive either LAIV or TIV 
when indicated or requested. All other persons, including 
pregnant women, should receive TIV.
</P><P>All HCP, as well as those in training for health-care professions, should be vaccinated annually against influenza. 
Persons working in health-care settings who should be vaccinated include physicians, nurses, and other workers in both hospital 
and outpatient-care settings, medical emergency-response workers (e.g., paramedics and emergency medical 
technicians), employees of nursing home and chronic-care facilities who have contact with patients or residents, and students in 
these professions who will have contact with patients 
(<I>339,<a href="rr5502a1.htm">340</a>,349</I>).
</P><P>Facilities that employ HCP should provide vaccine to workers by using approaches that have been demonstrated to 
be effective in increasing vaccination coverage. Health-care 
administrators should consider the level of vaccination 
coverage among HCP to be one measure of a patient safety quality program and consider obtaining signed declinations from 
personnel who decline influenza vaccination for reasons other than medical contraindications 
(<I><a href="rr5502a1.htm">340</a></I>). Influenza vaccination rates among HCP within facilities should be regularly measured and reported, and ward-, unit-, and specialty-specific coverage rates 
should 

be provided to staff and administration 
(<I><a href="rr5502a1.htm">340</a></I>). Studies have demonstrated that organized campaigns can attain higher rates 
of vaccination among HCP with moderate effort and by using strategies that increase vaccine 
acceptance (<I>338,<a href="rr5502a1.htm">340</a>,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5408a2.htm">350</a></I>).
</P><P>Efforts to increase vaccination coverage among HCP are supported by various national accrediting and 
professional organizations and in certain states by statute. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health-Care Organizations 
has approved an infection-control standard that requires accredited organizations to offer influenza vaccinations to 
staff, including volunteers and licensed independent practitioners with close patient contact. The standard became an 
accreditation requirement beginning January 1, 2007 
(<I>351</I>). In addition, the Infectious Diseases Society of America 
recommended mandatory vaccination for HCP, with a provision for declination of vaccination based on religious or medical reasons 
(<I>352</I>). Fifteen states have regulations regarding vaccination of HCP in long-term<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>care facilities 
(<I>353</I>), six states require that health-care facilities offer influenza vaccination to HCP, and four states require that HCP either receive influenza vaccination 
or indicate a religious, medical, or philosophical reason for not being vaccinated 
(<I>354,355</I>).
</P><P><B>Close Contacts of Immunocompromised Persons</B>
</P><P>Immunocompromised persons are at risk for influenza complications but might have insufficient responses to 
vaccination. Close contacts of immunocompromised persons, including HCP, should be vaccinated to reduce the risk for 
influenza transmission. TIV is preferred for vaccinating household members, HCP, and others who have close contact with 
severely immunosuppressed persons (e.g., patients with 
hematopoietic stem cell transplants) during those periods in which 
the immunosuppressed person requires care in a protective environment (typically defined as a specialized patient-care area with 
a positive airflow relative to the corridor, high-efficiency particulate air filtration, and frequent air changes) 
(<I><a href="rr5502a1.htm">340</a>,<a href="rr5210a1.htm">356</a></I>).
</P><P>LAIV transmission from a recently vaccinated person causing clinically important illness in an 
immunocompromised contact has not been reported. The rationale for avoiding use of LAIV among HCP or other close contacts of 
severely immunocompromised patients is the theoretical risk that a live, attenuated vaccine virus could be transmitted to 
the severely immunosuppressed person. As a precautionary measure, HCP who receive LAIV should avoid providing care for 
severely immunosuppressed patients for 7 days after vaccination. Hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid contact 
with severely immunosuppressed persons in protected environments for 7 days after vaccination but should not be restricted 
from visiting less severely immunosuppressed 
patients.
</P><P>No preference is indicated for TIV use by persons who have close contact with persons with lesser degrees 
of immunosuppression (e.g., persons with diabetes, persons with asthma who take corticosteroids, persons who have 
recently received chemotherapy or radiation but who are not being cared for in a protective environment as defined above, or 
persons infected with HIV) or for TIV use by HCP or other healthy nonpregnant persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years in close contact 
with persons in all other groups at high risk.
</P><P><B>Pregnant Women</B>
</P><P>Pregnant women are at risk for influenza complications, and all women who are pregnant or will be pregnant 
during influenza season should be vaccinated. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American 
Academy of Family Physicians also have recommended routine vaccination of all pregnant women 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5540a10.htm">357</a></I>). No preference is indicated for use of TIV that does not contain thimerosal as a preservative (see Vaccine Preservative [Thimerosal] in Multidose Vials 
of TIV) for any group recommended for vaccination, including pregnant women. LAIV is not licensed for use in 
pregnant women. However, pregnant women do not need to avoid contact with persons recently vaccinated with LAIV.
</P><P><B>Breastfeeding Mothers</B>
</P><P>Vaccination is recommended for all persons, including breastfeeding women, who are contacts of infants or children 
aged <U>&lt;</U>59 months (i.e., &lt;5 years), because infants and young children are at high risk for influenza complications and are more 
likely to require medical care or hospitalization if 
infected. Breastfeeding does not affect the immune response adversely and is not 
a contraindication for vaccination (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5515a1.htm">197</a></I>). Women who are breastfeeding can receive either TIV or LAIV unless 
contraindicated because of other medical conditions.
</P><P><B>Travelers</B>
</P><P>The risk for exposure to influenza during travel depends on the time of year and destination. In the temperate regions of 
the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity occurs typically during April<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>September. In temperate climate zones of the 
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, travelers also can be exposed to influenza during the summer, especially when traveling as part 
of large tourist groups (e.g., on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world in which influenza viruses 
are circulating (<I>358,359</I>). In the tropics, influenza occurs throughout the year. In a study among Swiss travelers to tropical 
and subtropical countries, influenza was the most frequently acquired vaccine-preventable disease 
(<I>360</I>).
</P><P>Any traveler who wants to reduce the risk for influenza 
infection should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 
2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons at high risk for complications of influenza and who were not vaccinated 
with influenza vaccine during the preceding fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccine before travel if they plan to
<ul><LI> travel to the tropics,
</LI><LI> travel with organized tourist groups at any time of year, or
</LI><LI> travel to the Southern Hemisphere during April<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>September.
</ul><P>No information is available about the benefits of revaccinating persons before summer travel who already were 
vaccinated during the preceding fall. Persons at high risk who receive the previous season's vaccine before travel should be 
revaccinated with the current vaccine the following fall or winter. Persons at higher risk for influenza complications should consult 
with their health-care practitioner to discuss the risk for influenza or other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel 
during the summer.
</P><P><B>General Population</B>
</P><P>Vaccination is recommended for any person who wishes to reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza 
or transmitting influenza to others should they become infected. Healthy, nonpregnant persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years might choose to receive either TIV or LAIV. All other persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>6 months should receive TIV. Persons who provide essential 
community services should be considered for vaccination to minimize disruption of essential activities during influenza 
outbreaks. Students or other persons in institutional settings (e.g., those who reside in dormitories or correctional facilities) should 
be encouraged to receive vaccine to minimize morbidity and the disruption of routine activities during epidemics 
(<I>361,362</I>).
</P><P><B>Recommended Vaccines for Different Age Groups</B>
</P><P>When vaccinating children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>35 months with TIV, health-care providers should use TIV that has been licensed by 
the FDA for this age group (i.e., TIV manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur ([FluZone]). TIV from Novartis (Fluvirin) is 
FDA-approved in the United States for use among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>4 years. TIV from GlaxoSmithKline (Fluarix and FluLaval) 
or CSL Biotherapies (Afluria) is labeled for use in persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years because data to demonstrate efficacy among 
younger persons have not been provided to FDA. LAIV from MedImmune (FluMist) is licensed for use by healthy 
nonpregnant persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years (<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). A vaccine dose does not need to be repeated if inadvertently administered to a person 
who does not have an age indication for the vaccine formulation given. Expanded age and risk group 
indications for licensed vaccines are likely over the next several years, and vaccination providers should be alert to these changes. In addition, 
several new vaccine formulations are being evaluated in immunogenicity and efficacy trials; when licensed, these new products 
will increase the influenza vaccine supply and provide additional vaccine choices for practitioners and their patients.
</P><P><B>Influenza Vaccines and Use<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>of Influenza Antiviral Medications</B>
</P><P>Administration of TIV and influenza antivirals during the same medical visit is acceptable. The effect on safety 
and effectiveness of LAIV coadministration with influenza antiviral medications has not been studied. However, 
because influenza antivirals reduce replication of influenza viruses, LAIV should not be administered until 48 hours after cessation 
of influenza antiviral therapy, and influenza antiviral medications should not be administered for 2 weeks after receipt of 
LAIV. Persons receiving antivirals within the period 2 days before to 14 days after vaccination with LAIV should be 
revaccinated at a later date (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5515a1.htm">197</a>,252</I>).
</P><P><B>Persons Who Should Not Be Vaccinated with TIV</B>
</P><P>TIV should not be administered to persons known to have anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or to other components 
of the influenza vaccine. Prophylactic use of antiviral agents is an option for preventing influenza among such 
persons. Information about vaccine components is located in package inserts from each manufacturer. Persons with moderate 
to severe acute febrile illness usually should not be vaccinated until their symptoms have abated. However, minor illnesses with 
or without fever do not contraindicate use of influenza vaccine. GBS within 6 weeks following a previous dose of TIV 
is considered to be a precaution for use of TIV.
</P><P><B>Considerations When Using LAIV</B>
</P><P>LAIV is an option for vaccination of healthy, nonpregnant persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years, including HCP and other 
close contacts of high-risk persons (excepting severely immunocompromised persons who require care in a protected 
environment). No preference is indicated for LAIV or TIV when considering vaccination of healthy, nonpregnant persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years. Use of the term &quot;healthy&quot; in this recommendation refers to persons who do not have any of the underlying medical 
conditions that confer high risk for severe complications (see Persons Who Should Not Be Vaccinated with LAIV). However, 
during periods when inactivated vaccine is in short supply, use of LAIV is encouraged when feasible for eligible persons 
(including HCP) because use of LAIV by these persons might increase availability of TIV for persons in groups targeted for 
vaccination, but who cannot receive LAIV. Possible advantages of LAIV include its potential to induce a broad mucosal and 
systemic immune response in children, its ease of administration, and the possibly 
increased acceptability of an intranasal rather 
than intramuscular route of administration.
</P><P>If the vaccine recipient sneezes after administration, the dose should not be repeated. However, if nasal congestion is 
present that might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered 
until resolution of the illness, or TIV should be administered instead. No data exist about concomitant use of nasal 
corticosteroids or other intranasal medications 
(<I>252</I>).
</P><P>Although FDA licensure of LAIV excludes children aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 years with a history of asthma or recurrent wheezing, 
the precise risk, if any, of wheezing caused by LAIV among these children is unknown because experience with LAIV among 
these young children is limited. Young children might not have a history of recurrent wheezing if their exposure to 
respiratory viruses has been limited because of their age. Certain children might have a history of wheezing with respiratory illnesses 
but have not had asthma diagnosed. The following screening recommendations should be used to assist persons who 
administer influenza vaccines in providing the appropriate vaccine for children aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 years.
</P><P>Clinicians and vaccination programs should screen for possible reactive airways diseases when considering use of LAIV 
for children aged 2<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 years, and should avoid use of this vaccine in children with asthma or a recent wheezing episode. 
Health-care providers should consult the medical record, when available, to identify children aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 years with asthma or 
recurrent wheezing that might indicate asthma. In addition, to identify children who might be at greater risk for asthma and possibly 
at increased risk for wheezing after receiving LAIV, parents or caregivers of children aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 years should be asked: &quot;In the 
past 12 months, has a health-care provider ever told you that your child had wheezing or asthma?&quot; Children whose parents 
or caregivers answer &quot;yes&quot; to this question and children who have asthma or who had a wheezing episode noted in the 
medical record during the preceding 12 months should not receive LAIV. TIV is available for use in children with asthma or 
possible reactive airways diseases (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5646a4.htm">363</a></I>).
</P><P>LAIV can be administered to persons with minor acute illnesses (e.g., diarrhea or mild upper respiratory tract infection 
with or without fever). However, if nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of the vaccine to the 
nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered until resolution of the illness.
</P><P><B>Persons Who Should Not Be Vaccinated with LAIV</B>
</P><P>The effectiveness or safety of LAIV is not known for the following groups, and these persons should not be vaccinated 
with LAIV:
<ul><LI> persons with a history of hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, to any of the components of LAIV or to eggs.
</LI><LI> persons aged &lt;2 years or those aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 years;
</LI><LI> persons with any of the underlying medical conditions that serve as an indication for routine influenza 
vaccination, including asthma, reactive airways disease, or other chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems; 
other underlying medical conditions, including such metabolic diseases as diabetes, renal dysfunction, and 
hemoglobinopathies; or known or suspected immunodeficiency diseases or immunosuppressed states;
</LI><LI> children aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>4 years whose parents or caregivers 
report that a health-care provider has told them during the 
preceding 12 months that their child had wheezing or asthma, or whose medical record indicates a wheezing episode has 
occurred during the preceding 12 months;
</LI><LI> children or adolescents receiving aspirin or other salicylates (because of the association of Reye syndrome with 
wild-type influenza virus infection);
</LI><LI> persons with a history of GBS after influenza vaccination; or
</LI><LI> pregnant women.
</ul>
<P><B>Personnel Who Can Administer LAIV</B>
</P><P>Low-level introduction of vaccine viruses into the environment probably is unavoidable when administering LAIV. The 
risk for acquiring vaccine viruses from the environment is unknown but is probably low. Severely immunosuppressed 
persons should not administer LAIV. However, other persons at higher risk for influenza complications can administer LAIV. 
These include persons with underlying medical conditions placing them at higher risk or who are likely to be at 
risk, including pregnant women, persons with asthma, and 
persons aged <U>&gt;</U>50 years.
</P><P><B>Concurrent Administration of Influenza Vaccine with Other Vaccines</B>
</P><P>Use of LAIV concurrently with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) alone and MMR and varicella vaccine among 
children aged 12<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>15 months has been studied, and no interference with the immunogenicity to antigens in any of the vaccines 
was observed (<I>252,364</I>). Among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 years, the safety and immunogenicity of zoster vaccine and TIV was 
similar whether administered simultaneously or spaced 4 weeks apart 
(<I>365</I>). In the absence of specific data indicating 
interference, following ACIP's general recommendations for vaccination is prudent 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5515a1.htm">197</a></I>). Inactivated vaccines do not interfere with 
the immune response to other inactivated vaccines or to live vaccines. Inactivated or live vaccines can be 
administered simultaneously with LAIV. However, after 
administration of a live vaccine, at least 4 weeks should pass before another 
live vaccine is administered.
</P><h3 align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Recommendations for Vaccination Administration and Vaccination Programs</FONT></B>
</h3><P>Although influenza vaccination levels increased substantially during the 1990s, little progress has been made 
toward achieving national health objectives, and further improvements in vaccine coverage levels are needed. Strategies to 
improve vaccination levels, including using reminder/recall systems and standing orders programs 
(<I>325,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5405a1.htm">366</a>,367</I>), should be implemented whenever feasible. Vaccination coverage can be 
increased by administering vaccine before and during 
the influenza season to persons during hospitalizations or routine health-care visits. Vaccinations can be provided in 
alternative settings (e.g., pharmacies, grocery stores, workplaces, or other locations in the community), thereby making special visits 
to physicians' offices or clinics unnecessary. Coordinated campaigns such as the National Influenza Vaccination 
Week (December 8<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>14, 2008) provide opportunities to refocus public attention on the benefits, safety, and availability 
of influenza vaccination throughout the influenza season. When educating patients about potential adverse events, 
clinicians should emphasize that 1) TIV contains noninfectious killed viruses and cannot cause influenza, 2) LAIV contains 
weakened influenza viruses that cannot replicate outside the upper respiratory tract and are unlikely to infect others, and 3) 
concomitant symptoms or respiratory disease unrelated to vaccination with either TIV or LAIV can occur after vaccination.
</P><P><B>Information About the Vaccines<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>for Children Program</B>
</P><P>The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program supplies vaccine to all states, territories, and the District of Columbia for use 
by participating providers. These vaccines are to be provided to eligible children without vaccine cost to the patient or 
the provider, although the provider might charge a vaccine administration fee. All routine childhood vaccines recommended 
by 

ACIP are available through this program, including influenza vaccines. The program saves parents and providers 
out-of-pocket expenses for vaccine purchases and provides cost savings to states through CDC's vaccine contracts. The program results 
in lower vaccine prices and ensures that all states pay the same contract prices. Detailed information about the VFC program 
is available at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/default.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/default.htm</a>.
</P><P><B>Influenza Vaccine Supply Considerations</B>
</P><P>The annual supply of influenza vaccine and the timing of its distribution cannot be guaranteed in any year. During 
the 2007<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 influenza season, 113 million doses of influenza vaccine were distributed in the United States. Total production 
of influenza vaccine for the United States is anticipated to be &gt;130 million doses for the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 season, depending on 
demand and production yields. However, influenza vaccine distribution delays or vaccine shortages remain possible in part because 
of the inherent critical time constraints in manufacturing the vaccine given the annual updating of the influenza vaccine 
strains and various other manufacturing and regulatory issues. To ensure optimal use of available doses of influenza vaccine, 
health-care providers, those planning organized campaigns, and state and local public health agencies should develop plans 
for expanding outreach and infrastructure to vaccinate more persons in targeted groups and others who wish to reduce their 
risk for influenza and develop contingency plans for the timing and prioritization of administering influenza vaccine if the 
supply of vaccine is delayed or reduced.
</P><P>If supplies of TIV are not adequate, vaccination should be carried out in accordance with local circumstances of supply 
and demand based on the judgment of state and local health officials and health-care providers. Guidance for tiered use of 
TIV during prolonged distribution delays or supply 
shortfalls is available at 
		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/vax_priority.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/vax_priority.htm</a> and will be modified as needed in the event of shortage. CDC and other public health agencies will assess 
the vaccine supply on a continuing basis throughout the manufacturing period and will inform both providers and the 
general public if any indication exists of a substantial 
delay or an inadequate supply.
</P><P>Because LAIV is only recommended for use in healthy nonpregnant persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years, no recommendations 
for prioritization of LAIV use are made. Either LAIV or TIV when considering vaccination of healthy, nonpregnant persons 
aged 2<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years. However, during shortages of TIV, LAIV should be used preferentially when feasible for all healthy 
nonpregnant persons aged 2<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>49 years (including HCP) who desire or are recommended for vaccination to increase the availability 
of inactivated vaccine for persons at high risk.
</P><P><B>Timing of Vaccination</B>
</P><P>Vaccination efforts should be structured to ensure the vaccination of as many persons as possible over the course of 
several months, with emphasis on vaccinating before influenza activity in the community begins. Even if vaccine distribution 
begins before October, distribution probably will not be completed until December or January. The following 
recommendations reflect this phased distribution of vaccine.
</P><P>In any given year, the optimal time to vaccinate patients cannot be precisely determined because influenza seasons vary 
in their timing and duration, and more than one outbreak might occur in a single community in a single year. In the 
United States, localized outbreaks that indicate the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, 
in &gt;80% of influenza seasons since 1976, peak influenza activity (which is often close to the midpoint of influenza 
activity for the season) has not occurred until January or later, and in &gt;60% of seasons, the peak was in February or later (<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). 
In general, health-care providers should begin offering 
vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available and if possible 
by October. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health-care visits 
or during hospitalizations whenever vaccine is available.
</P><P>Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season, because the duration of the influenza season varies, 
and influenza might not appear in certain communities until February or March. Providers should offer influenza 
vaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should continue throughout the influenza season, including after 
influenza activity has begun in the community. Vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already 
begun, is likely to be beneficial in the majority of influenza seasons. The majority of adults have antibody protection against 
influenza virus infection within 2 weeks after vaccination 
(<I>368,369</I>).
</P><P>All children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>8 years who have not received vaccination against influenza previously should receive their 
first dose as soon after vaccine becomes available as is feasible. This practice increases the opportunity for both doses to 
be administered before or shortly after the onset of influenza 
activity.
</P><P>Persons and institutions planning substantial organized vaccination campaigns (e.g., health departments, 
occupational health clinics, and community vaccinators) should consider scheduling these events after at least mid-October because 
the availability of vaccine in any location cannot be ensured consistently in early fall. Scheduling campaigns 
after mid-October will minimize the need for cancellations because vaccine is unavailable. These vaccination clinics should be 
scheduled through December, and later if feasible, with attention to settings that serve children aged 6<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>59 months, pregnant 
women, other persons aged &lt;50 years at increased risk for influenza-related complications, persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 years, HCP, and persons who are household contacts of children aged 
<U>&lt;</U>59 months or other persons at high risk. Planners are encouraged 
to develop the capacity and flexibility to schedule at least one vaccination clinic in 
December. Guidelines for planning large-scale vaccination clinics are available at 
		<a href="../../../flu/professionals/vaccination/vax_clinic.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/vax_clinic.htm</a>.
</P><P>During a vaccine shortage or delay, substantial proportions of TIV doses may not be released and distributed 
until November and December or later. When the vaccine is substantially delayed or disease activity has not subsided, 
providers should consider offering vaccination clinics into January and beyond as long as vaccine supplies are available. Campaigns 
using LAIV also can extend into January and beyond.
</P><P><B>Strategies for Implementing Vaccination Recommendations<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>in Health-Care Settings</B>
</P><P>Successful vaccination programs combine publicity and education for HCP and other potential vaccine recipients, a plan 
for identifying persons recommended for vaccination, use of reminder/recall systems, assessment of practice-level vaccination 
rates with feedback to staff, and efforts to remove administrative and financial barriers that prevent persons from receiving 
the vaccine, including use of standing orders programs 
(<I>367,370</I>). The use of standing orders programs by long-term<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>care facilities (e.g., nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities), hospitals, and home health agencies ensures that vaccination 
is offered. Standing orders programs for influenza vaccination should be conducted under the supervision of a 
licensed practitioner according to a physician-approved facility or agency policy by HCP trained to screen patients 
for contraindications to vaccination, administer vaccine, and monitor for adverse events. CMS has removed the 
physician signature requirement for the administration of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines to Medicare and Medicaid patients 
in hospitals, long-term<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>care facilities, and home health agencies 
(<I>371</I>). To the extent allowed by local and state law, 
these facilities and agencies can implement standing orders for 
influenza and pneumococcal vaccination of Medicare- and 
Medicaid-eligible patients. Payment for influenza vaccine under Medicare Part B is available 
(<I>372,373</I>). Other settings (e.g., outpatient facilities, managed care organizations, assisted living facilities, correctional facilities, pharmacies, and adult workplaces) 
are encouraged to introduce standing orders programs 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4901a2.htm">374</a></I>). In addition, physician reminders (e.g., flagging charts) and 
patient reminders are recognized strategies for increasing 
rates of influenza vaccination. Persons for whom influenza vaccine 
is recommended can be identified and vaccinated in the settings described in the following sections.
</P><P><B>Outpatient Facilities Providing Ongoing Care</B>
</P><P>Staff in facilities providing ongoing medical care (e.g., physicians' offices, public health clinics, employee health 
clinics, hemodialysis centers, hospital specialty-care clinics, and outpatient rehabilitation programs) should identify and label 
the medical records of patients who should receive vaccination. Vaccine should be offered during visits throughout the 
influenza season. The offer of vaccination and its receipt or refusal should be documented in the medical record. Patients for 
whom vaccination is recommended and who do not have regularly scheduled visits during the fall should be reminded by 
mail, telephone, or other means of the need for vaccination.
</P><P><B>Outpatient Facilities Providing Episodic or Acute Care</B>
</P><P>Acute health-care facilities (e.g., emergency departments and walk-in clinics) should offer vaccinations throughout 
the influenza season to persons for whom vaccination is recommended or provide written information regarding why, where, 
and how to obtain the vaccine. This written information should be available in languages appropriate for the populations served 
by the facility.
</P><P><B>Nursing Homes and Other Residential Long-Term<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>Care Facilities</B>
</P><P>Vaccination should be provided routinely to all residents of chronic-care facilities. If possible, all residents should 
be vaccinated at one time before influenza season. In the majority of seasons, TIV will become available to long-term<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>care facilities in October or November, and vaccination should commence as soon as vaccine is available. As soon as possible 
after admission to the facility, the benefits and risks of vaccination should be discussed and education materials provided. 
Signed consent is not required (<I>375</I>). Residents admitted after completion of the vaccination program at the facility should 
be vaccinated at the time of admission through March.
</P><P>Since October 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has required nursing homes participating 
in the Medicare and Medicaid programs to offer all residents influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and to document the 
results. According to the requirements, each resident is to be vaccinated unless contraindicated medically, the resident or a 
legal representative refuses vaccination, or the vaccine is not available because of shortage. This information is to be 
reported as part of the CMS Minimum Data Set, which tracks nursing home health parameters 
(<I>372,376</I>).
</P><P><B>Acute-Care Hospitals</B>
</P><P>Hospitals should serve as a key setting for identifying persons at increased risk for influenza complications. 
Unvaccinated persons of all ages (including children) with high-risk conditions and persons aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 years or <U>&gt;</U>50 years who 
are hospitalized at any time during the period when vaccine is available should be offered and strongly encouraged to 
receive influenza vaccine before they are discharged. Standing orders to offer influenza vaccination to all hospitalized persons 
should be considered.
</P><P><B>Visiting Nurses and Others Providing Home Care to Persons at High Risk</B>
</P><P>Nursing-care plans should identify patients for whom vaccination is recommended, and vaccine should be administered 
in the home, if necessary as soon as influenza vaccine is available and throughout the influenza season. Caregivers and 
other persons in the household (including children) should be 
referred for vaccination.
</P><P><B>Other Facilities Providing Services to Persons Aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 Years</B>
</P><P>Facilities providing services to persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 years (e.g., assisted living housing, retirement communities, and 
recreation centers) should offer unvaccinated residents, attendees, and staff annual on-site vaccination before the start of the 
influenza season. Continuing to offer vaccination throughout the fall and winter months is appropriate. Efforts to vaccinate 
newly admitted patients or new employees also should be continued, both to prevent illness and to avoid having these persons 
serve as a source of new influenza infections. Staff education should emphasize the need for influenza vaccine.
</P><P><B>Health-Care Personnel</B>
</P><P>Health-care facilities should offer influenza vaccinations to all HCP, including night, weekend, and temporary 
staff. Particular emphasis should be placed on providing vaccinations to workers who provide direct care for persons at high risk 
for influenza complications. Efforts should be made to educate HCP regarding the benefits of vaccination and the potential 
health consequences of influenza illness for their patients, themselves, and their family members. All HCP should be 
provided convenient access to influenza vaccine at the work site, free of charge, as part of employee health programs 
(<I><a href="rr5502a1.htm">340</a>,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5408a2.htm">350</a>,351</I>).

</h3><P>Although available influenza vaccines are effective and safe, additional research is needed to improve prevention 
efforts. Most mortality from influenza occurs among person aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years (<I>6</I>), and more immunogenic influenza vaccines are 
needed for this age group and other risk groups at high risk for mortality. Additional research is also needed to understand 
potential biases in estimating the benefits of vaccination among older adults in reducing hospitalizations and deaths 
(<I>101,193,377</I>)<I>. </I>Additional studies of the relative 
cost-effectiveness and cost utility of influenza vaccination among children and 
adults, especially those aged &lt;65 years, are needed and should be designed to account for year-to-year variations in influenza 
attack rates, illness severity, hospitalization costs and rates, and vaccine effectiveness when evaluating the long-term costs and 
benefits 

of annual vaccination (<I>378</I>). Additional data on indirect effects of vaccination are also needed to quantify the benefits 
of influenza vaccination of HCP in protecting their patients 
(<I>294</I>) and the benefits of vaccinating children to reduce 
influenza complications among those at risk. Because of expansions in ACIP recommendations for vaccination will lead to more 
persons being vaccinated, much larger research networks are needed that can identify and 
assess the causality of very rare events that occur after vaccination, including GBS. These research networks could also provide a platform for effectiveness and 
safety studies in the event of a pandemic. Research on potential biologic or genetic risk factors for GBS also is needed. In addition, 
a better understanding of how to motivate persons at risk to seek annual influenza vaccination is needed.
</P><P>ACIP continues to review new vaccination strategies to protect against influenza, including the possibility of 
expanding routine influenza vaccination recommendations toward universal vaccination or other approaches that will help reduce 
or prevent the transmission of influenza and reduce the burden of severe disease 
(<I>379<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>384</I>). The expansion of annual 
vaccination recommendations to include all children aged 6 months<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>18 years will require a substantial increase in resources 
for epidemiologic research to develop long term studies 
capable of assessing the possible effects on community-level 
transmission. Additional planning to improve surveillance systems capable of monitoring effectiveness, safety and vaccine coverage, 
and further development of implementation strategies will also be necessary. In addition, as noted by the National 
Vaccine Advisory Committee, strengthening the U.S. influenza vaccination system will require improving vaccine financing 
and demand and implementing systems to help better understand the burden of influenza in the United States 
(<I>385</I>). Vaccination programs capable of delivering annual 
influenza vaccination to a broad range of the population could potentially serve as 
a resilient and sustainable platform for delivering vaccines and monitoring outcomes for other 
urgently required public health interventions (e.g., vaccines for pandemic influenza or medications to prevent or treat illnesses caused by acts of terrorism).

</h3><P>Human infection with novel or nonhuman influenza A 
virus strains, including influenza A viruses of animal origin, is 
a nationally notifiable disease (<I>386</I>). Human infections with nonhuman or novel human influenza A virus should be 
identified quickly and investigated to determine possible sources of exposure, identify additional cases, and evaluate the possibility 
of human-to-human transmission because transmission patterns could change over time with variations in these 
influenza A viruses.
</P><P>Sporadic severe and fatal human cases of infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have 
been identified in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, primarily among persons who have had direct or close 
unprotected contact with sick or dead birds associated with the ongoing H5N1 panzootic among birds 
(<I>387<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>392</I>). Limited, 
nonsustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 viruses has likely occurred in some case clusters 
(<I>393,394</I>). To date, no evidence exists of genetic reassortment between human influenza A and H5N1 viruses. However, influenza viruses derived from 
strains circulating among poultry (e.g., the H5N1 viruses that have caused outbreaks of avian influenza and 
occasionally have infected humans) have the potential to 
recombine with human influenza A viruses 
(<I>395,396</I>). To date, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses have not been identified in wild or domestic birds or in humans in the United 
States.
</P><P>Human illness from infection with different avian influenza A subtype viruses also have been documented, 
including infections with low pathogenic and highly pathogenic viruses. A range of clinical illness has been reported for human 
infection with low pathogenic avian influenza viruses, including conjunctivitis with influenza A(H7N7) virus in the U.K., 
lower respiratory tract disease and conjunctivitis with influenza A(H7N2) 
virus in the U.K., and uncomplicated influenza-like 
illness with influenza A(H9N2) virus in Hong Kong and China 
(<I>397<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>402</I>). Two human cases of infection with low 
pathogenic influenza A(H7N2) were reported in the United States 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5325a1.htm">400</a></I>). Although human infections with highly pathogenic 
A(H7N7) virus infections typically have influenza-like illness or conjunctivitis, severe infections, including one fatal case in 
the Netherlands, have been reported 
(<I>403,404</I>). Conjunctivitis has also been reported because of human infection with 
highly pathogenic influenza A(H7N3) virus in Canada and low pathogenic A(H7N3) in the U.K 
(<I>397,404</I>). In contrast, sporadic infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have caused severe illness in many countries, with 
an overall case-fatality ratio of &gt;60% 
(<I>394,405</I>).
</P><P>Swine influenza A(H1N1), A(H1N2), and A(H3N2) viruses 
are endemic among pig populations in the United States 
(<I>406</I>), including reassortant viruses. Two clusters of influenza A(H2N3) virus infections among pigs have been 
recently reported (<I>407</I>). Outbreaks among pigs normally occur in colder weather months (late fall and winter) and sometimes with 
the 

introduction of new pigs into susceptible herds. An estimated 30% of the pig population in the United States has 
serologic evidence of having had swine influenza A(H1N1) virus infection. Sporadic human infections with swine influenza A 
viruses occur in the United States, but the frequency of these human infections is unknown. Persons infected with swine influenza 
A viruses typically report direct contact with ill pigs or places where pigs have been present (e.g., agricultural fairs or farms), 
and have symptoms that are clinically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory viruses 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5638a4.htm">408</a></I>). Clinicians should consider swine influenza A virus 
infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with ILI who have had recent contact 
with pigs. The sporadic cases identified in recent years have not resulted in sustained 
human-to-human transmission of swine influenza A viruses or community outbreaks. Although immunity to swine influenza A viruses appears to be low in the 
overall human population (&lt;2%), 10%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>20% of persons occupationally exposed to pigs (e.g., pig farmers or pig veterinarians) 
have been documented in certain studies to have antibody evidence of prior swine influenza A(H1N1) virus infection 
(<I>409,410</I>).
</P><P>Current seasonal influenza vaccines are not expected to provide protection against human infection with avian influenza 
A viruses, including H5N1 viruses, or to provide protection against currently circulating swine influenza A viruses. 
However, reducing seasonal influenza risk through influenza vaccination of persons who might be exposed to nonhuman 
influenza viruses (e.g., H5N1 viruses) might reduce the theoretical risk for recombination of influenza A viruses of animal origin 
and human influenza A viruses by preventing seasonal influenza A virus infection within a human host.
</P><P>CDC has recommended that persons who are charged with responding to avian influenza outbreaks among 
poultry receive seasonal influenza vaccination 
(<I>411</I>). As part of preparedness activities, the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA) has issued an advisory notice regarding poultry worker safety that is intended for implementation 
in the event of a suspected or confirmed avian influenza outbreak at a poultry facility in the United States. OSHA 
guidelines recommend that poultry workers in an involved facility receive vaccination against seasonal influenza; OSHA also 
has recommended that HCP involved in the care of patients with documented or suspected avian influenza should be 
vaccinated with the most recent seasonal human influenza vaccine to 
reduce the risk for co-infection with human influenza 
A viruses (<I>412</I>).
</P><h3 align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Recommendations for Using Antiviral Agents for Seasonal Influenza</FONT></B>
</h3><P>Annual vaccination is the primary strategy for preventing complications of influenza virus infections. Antiviral 
medications with activity against influenza viruses are useful adjuncts in the prevention of influenza, and effective when used early in 
the course of illness for treatment. Four influenza antiviral agents are licensed in the United 
States: amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir. Influenza A virus 
resistance to amantadine and rimantadine can emerge rapidly during 
treatment. Because antiviral testing results indicated high levels of resistance 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5502a7.htm">413</a><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>416</I>), neither amantadine nor rimantadine should 
be used for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza A in the United States during the 
2007<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 influenza 
season. Surveillance demonstrating that susceptibility to these antiviral medications has been reestablished among circulating 
influenza A viruses will be needed before amantadine or rimantadine can be used for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza 
A. Oseltamivir or zanamivir can be prescribed if antiviral chemoprophylaxis or treatment of influenza is indicated. Oseltamivir 
is licensed for treatment of influenza in persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>1 year, and zanamivir is licensed for treating influenza in persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>7 years. Oseltamivir and zanamivir can be used for chemoprophylaxis of influenza; oseltamivir is licensed for use 
as chemoprophylaxis in persons aged <U>&gt;</U>1 year, and zanamivir is licensed for use in persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>5 years.
</P><P>During the 2007<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 influenza season, influenza A (H1N1) viruses with a mutation that confers resistance to 
oseltamivir were identified in the United States and other countries. As of June 27, 2008, in the United States, 111 (7.6%) of 
1,464 influenza A viruses tested, and none of 305 influenza B 
viruses tested have been found to be resistant to oseltamivir. All of 
the resistant viruses identified in the United States and elsewhere are influenza A (H1N1) viruses. Of 1020 influenza A 
(H1N1) viruses isolated from patients in the United States, 111 (10.9%) exhibited a specific genetic mutation that confers 
oseltamivir resistance (<I><a href="mm5631a2.htm">417</a></I>). Influenza A (H1N1) virus strains that are resistant to oseltamivir remain sensitive to 
zanamivir. Neuraminidase inhibitor medications continue to be the recommended agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis 
of influenza in the United States. However, clinicians should be alert to changes in antiviral recommendations that might 
occur as additional antiviral resistance data becomes available during the 2008<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>09 influenza season (<a href="../../../flu/professionals/antivirals/index.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/index.htm</a>).
</P><P><B>Role of Laboratory Diagnosis</B>
</P><P>Influenza surveillance information and diagnostic testing can aid clinical judgment and help guide treatment 
decisions. However, only 69% of practitioners in one recent survey 
indicated that they test patients for influenza during 
the influenza season (<I><a href="mm5703a1.htm">418</a></I>). The accuracy of clinical diagnosis of influenza on the basis of symptoms alone is limited 
because symptoms from illness caused by other pathogens can overlap considerably with influenza 
(<I>26,39,40</I>) (see Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Influenza).
</P><P>Diagnostic tests available for influenza include viral culture, serology, rapid antigen testing, reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunofluorescence assays 
(<I>419</I>). As with any diagnostic test, results should be evaluated 
in the context of other clinical and epidemiologic information available to health-care providers. Sensitivity and specificity of 
any test for influenza can vary by the laboratory that performs the test, the type of test used, the type of specimen tested, 
the quality of the specimen, and the timing of specimen collection in relation to illness onset. Among respiratory specimens 
for viral isolation or rapid detection of influenza viruses, nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens have higher yields than throat 
swab specimens (<I>420</I>). In addition, positive influenza tests have been reported up to 7 days after receipt of LAIV 
(<I>421</I>).
</P><P>Commercial rapid diagnostic tests are available that can detect influenza viruses within 30 minutes 
(<I>422,423</I>). Certain tests are licensed for use in any outpatient setting, whereas others must be used in a moderately complex clinical laboratory. 
These rapid tests differ in the types of influenza viruses they can detect and whether they can distinguish between 
influenza types. Different tests can detect 1) only influenza A viruses; 2) both influenza A and B viruses, but not distinguish between the 
two types; or 3) both influenza A and B and distinguish between the two. None of the rapid influenza 
diagnostic tests specifically identifies any influenza A virus subtypes.
</P><P>The types of specimens acceptable for use (i.e., throat, 
nasopharyngeal, or nasal aspirates, swabs, or washes) also vary by 
test, but all perform best when collected as close to illness onset as possible. The specificity and, in particular, the sensitivity 
of rapid tests are lower than for viral culture and vary by test 
(<I>419,422<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>424</I>). Rapid tests for influenza have high 
specificity (&gt;90%), but are only moderately sensitive (&lt;70%). 
A recent study found sensitivity to be as low as 42% in clinical 
practice (<I>425</I>). Rapid tests appear to have higher sensitivity when used in young children, compared with adults, possibly 
because young children with influenza typically shed higher concentrations of influenza viruses than adults 
(<I>426</I>). Since RT-PCR has high sensitivity to detect influenza virus infection compared to viral culture, rapid tests have lower 
sensitivity than viral culture when compared to RT-PCR.
</P><P>The limitations of rapid diagnostic tests must be understood in order to properly interpret results. Positive 
rapid influenza test results are generally reliable when community influenza activity is high and are useful in deciding whether 
to initiate antiviral treatment. Negative rapid test results are less helpful in making treatment decisions for 
individual patients when influenza activity in a community is high. 
Because of the lower sensitivity of the rapid tests, physicians 
should consider confirming negative tests with viral culture or other means because of the possibility of false-negative rapid 
test results, especially during periods of peak community 
influenza activity. The positive predictive value of rapid tests will 
be lower during periods of low influenza activity, and clinicians should consider the positive and negative predictive values of 
the test in the context of the level of influenza activity in their community when interpreting results 
(<I>424</I>). When local influenza activity is high, persons with severe respiratory symptoms or persons with acute respiratory illness who are at higher risk 
for influenza complications should still be considered for influenza antiviral treatment despite a negative rapid influenza 
test unless illness can be attributed to another cause. However, because certain bacterial infections can produce symptoms 
similar to influenza, if bacterial infections are suspected, they should be considered and treated appropriately. In addition, 
secondary invasive bacterial infections can be a severe complication of influenza. Package inserts and the laboratory performing the 
test should be consulted for more details regarding use of rapid diagnostic tests. Additional 
updated information concerning diagnostic testing is 
available at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/labdiagnosis.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/labdiagnosis.htm</a>.
</P><P>Despite the availability of rapid diagnostic tests, clinical specimens collected in virus surveillance systems for viral culture 
are critical for surveillance purposes. Only culture isolates of influenza viruses can provide specific 
information regarding circulating strains and subtypes of influenza viruses and data on antiviral resistance. This information is needed 
to compare current circulating influenza strains with vaccine strains, to guide decisions regarding influenza treatment 
and chemoprophylaxis, and to formulate vaccine for the coming year. Virus isolates also are needed to monitor antiviral 
resistance and the emergence of novel human influenza A virus subtypes that might pose a pandemic threat. Influenza surveillance 
by 

state and local health departments and CDC can provide information regarding the circulation of influenza 
viruses in the community, which can help inform decisions about the likelihood that a compatible clinical syndrome is indeed influenza.
</P><P><B>Antiviral Agents for Influenza</B>
</P><P>Zanamivir and oseltamivir are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that 
have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. The two medications differ in pharmacokinetics, adverse events, routes 
of administration, approved age groups, dosages, and costs. An overview of the indications, use, administration, and 
known primary adverse events of these medications is presented in the following sections. Package inserts should be consulted 
for additional information. Detailed information about amantadine and rimantadine (adamantanes) is available in previous 
ACIP influenza recommendations (<I><a href="rr5408a1.htm">427</a></I>).
</P><P><B>Indications for Use of Antivirals
</P><P>Treatment</B>
</P><P>Initiation of antiviral treatment within 2 days of illness 
onset is recommended, although the benefit of treatment is greater 
as the time after illness onset is reduced. Certain persons have a high priority for treatment 
(<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#box3">Box 3</a>); however, treatment does not need to be limited to these persons. In clinical trials conducted in outpatient settings, the benefit of antiviral treatment 
for uncomplicated influenza was minimal unless treatment was initiated within 48 hours after illness onset. However, no data 
are available on the benefit for severe influenza when antiviral treatment is initiated &gt;2 days after illness onset. The 
recommended duration of treatment with either zanamivir or oseltamivir is 5 days.
</P><P>Evidence for the efficacy of these antiviral drugs is based primarily on studies of outpatients with uncomplicated 
influenza. When administered within 2 days of illness onset to otherwise healthy children or adults, zanamivir or oseltamivir can 
reduce the duration of uncomplicated influenza A and B illness by approximately 1 day compared with placebo 
(<I>143,428<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>442</I>). Minimal or no benefit was reported when antiviral treatment is initiated &gt;2 days after onset of uncomplicated influenza. 
Data on whether viral shedding is reduced are inconsistent. The duration of viral shedding was reduced in one study that 
employed experimental infection; however, other studies have not demonstrated reduction in the duration of viral shedding. A 
recent review that examined neuraminidase inhibitor effect on reducing ILI concluded that neuraminidase inhibitors were 
not effective in the control of seasonal influenza 
(<I>443</I>). However, lower or no effectiveness using a nonspecific (compared 
with laboratory-confirmed influenza) clinical endpoint such as ILI would be expected 
(<I>444</I>).
</P><P>Data are limited about the effectiveness of zanamivir and oseltamivir in preventing serious influenza-related 
complications (e.g., bacterial or viral pneumonia or exacerbation of chronic diseases), or for preventing influenza among persons at high 
risk for serious complications of influenza. In a study that combined data from 10 clinical trials, the risk for pneumonia 
among those participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza receiving oseltamivir was approximately 50% lower than among 
those persons receiving a placebo and 34% lower among patients at risk for complications (p&lt;0.05 for both comparisons) 
(<I>445</I>). Although a similar significant reduction also was determined for hospital admissions among the overall group, the 
50% reduction in hospitalizations reported in the small subset of high-risk participants was not statistically significant. 
One randomized controlled trial documented a decreased incidence of otitis media among children treated with oseltamivir 
(<I>437</I>). Another randomized controlled study conducted among influenza-infected children with asthma demonstrated 
significantly greater improvement in lung function and fewer asthma exacerbations among oseltamivir-treated children compared 
with those who received placebo but did not determine a difference in symptom duration 
(<I>446</I>). Inadequate data exist regarding the efficacy of any of the influenza antiviral drugs for use among children aged &lt;1 year, and none are FDA-licensed for use in 
this age group.
</P><P>Two observational studies suggest that oseltamivir reduces severe clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with influenza. 
A large prospective observational study assessed clinical outcomes among 327 hospitalized adults with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza whose health-care provider chose to use oseltamivir treatment compared to untreated influenza 
patients. The average age of adults in this study was 77 years, and 71% began treatment &gt;48 hours after illness onset. In 
the multivariate analysis, oseltamivir treatment was associated with a significantly decreased risk for death within 15 days 
of hospitalization (odds ratio = 0.21; CI = 0.06<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>0.80). Benefit was observed 
even among those starting treatment &gt;48 hours after 
symptom onset. However, oseltamivir treatment did not significantly reduce the duration of hospitalization or 30 
day 

mortality after hospitalization. An additional 185 hospitalized children with laboratory confirmed influenza were 
identified during this study, but none received antiviral treatment and no assessment of outcomes based on receipt of 
antiviral treatment could be made (<I>95</I>). A retrospective 
cohort study of 99 hospitalized persons with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza administered who received oseltamivir that was conducted in Hong Kong reported that persons who received oseltamivir treatment 
&gt;48 hours from illness onset had a median length of stay of 6 days compared to 4 days for persons who received oseltamivir 
within 48 hours of symptom onset (p&lt;0.0001) 
(<I>447</I>). However, additional data on the impact of antiviral treatment on 
severe outcomes are needed.
</P><P>More clinical data are available concerning the efficacy of zanamivir and oseltamivir for treatment of influenza A 
virus infection than for treatment of influenza B virus infection. Data from human clinical studies have indicated that 
zanamivir and oseltamivir have activity against influenza B viruses 
(<I>437,448<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>451</I>). However, an observational study among 
Japanese children with culture-confirmed influenza and treated with oseltamivir demonstrated that children with influenza A 
virus infection resolved fever and stopped shedding virus more quickly than children with influenza B, suggesting that 
oseltamivir might be less effective for the treatment of influenza B 
(<I>452</I>).
</P><P>The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society have recommended that persons 
with community-acquired pneumonia and laboratory-confirmed influenza should receive either oseltamivir or zanamivir 
if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. 
Patients who present &gt;48 hours after illness onset are 
potential candidates for treatment if they have influenza pneumonia or to reduce viral shedding while hospitalized 
(<I>453</I>). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends antiviral treatment of any child with influenza who is also at high risk of 
influenza complications, regardless of vaccination status, and any otherwise healthy child with moderate-to-severe influenza 
infection who might benefit from the decrease in duration of clinical symptoms documented to occur with therapy 
(<I>454</I>).
</P><P><B>Chemoprophylaxis</B>
</P><P>Chemoprophylactic drugs are not a substitute for vaccination, although they are critical adjuncts in preventing 
and controlling influenza. Certain persons are at higher priority for chemoprophylaxis 
(<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#box4">Box 4</a>); however, chemoprophylaxis does not need to be limited to these persons. In community studies of healthy adults, both oseltamivir and zanamivir had 
similar efficacy in preventing febrile, laboratory-confirmed influenza illness (efficacy: zanamivir, 84%; oseltamivir, 82%) 
(<I>455,456</I>). Both antiviral agents also have prevented influenza illness among persons administered chemoprophylaxis after a 
household member had influenza diagnosed (efficacy: zanamivir, 72%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>82%; oseltamivir, 68%<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>89%) (<I>455<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>459</I>). Studies have demonstrated moderate to excellent efficacy for prevention of influenza among patients in institutional settings 
(<I>460<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>465</I>). For example, a 6-week study of oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis among nursing home residents demonstrated a 92% 
reduction in influenza illness (<I>464</I>). A 4-week study among community-dwelling persons at higher risk for influenza 
complications (median age: 60 years) demonstrated that zanamivir had an 83% effectiveness in preventing 
symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza 
(<I>465</I>). The efficacy of antiviral agents in preventing influenza among severely 
immunocompromised persons is unknown. A small nonrandomized study conducted in a stem cell transplant unit suggested that oseltamivir 
can prevent progression to pneumonia among influenza-infected patients 
(<I>466</I>).
</P><P>When determining the timing and duration for administering influenza antiviral medications for chemoprophylaxis, 
factors related to cost, compliance, and potential adverse events should be considered. To be maximally effective as 
chemoprophylaxis, the drug must be taken each day for the duration of influenza activity in the community. Additional clinical guidelines on 
the use of antiviral medications to prevent influenza 
are available (<I>453</I>,<I>454</I>).
</P><P><B>Persons at High Risk Who Are Vaccinated After Influenza Activity Has Begun</B>
</P><P>Development of antibodies in adults after vaccination takes approximately 2 weeks 
(<I>369,370</I>). Therefore, when influenza vaccine is administered after influenza activity in a community has begun, chemoprophylaxis should be considered for 
persons at higher risk for influenza complications during the time from vaccination until immunity has developed. Children aged 
&lt;9 years who receive influenza vaccination for the first time might require as much as 6 weeks of chemoprophylaxis 
(i.e., chemoprophylaxis until 2 weeks after the second dose when immunity after vaccination would be expected). Persons at 
higher risk for complications of influenza still can benefit from vaccination after community influenza activity has begun 
because influenza viruses might still be circulating at the time vaccine-induced immunity is achieved.
</P><P><B>Persons Who Provide Care to Those at High Risk</B>
</P><P>To reduce the spread of virus to persons at high risk, chemoprophylaxis during peak influenza activity can be considered 
for unvaccinated persons who have frequent contact with persons at high risk. Persons with frequent contact might 
include employees of hospitals, clinics, and chronic-care facilities, household members, visiting nurses, and volunteer workers. If 
an outbreak is caused by a strain of influenza that might not be covered by the vaccine, chemoprophylaxis can be considered 
for all such persons, regardless of their vaccination status.
</P><P><B>Persons Who Have Immune Deficiencies</B>
</P><P>Chemoprophylaxis can be considered for persons at high risk who are more likely to have an inadequate 
antibody response to influenza vaccine. This category includes persons infected with HIV, particularly those with advanced HIV 
disease. No published data are available concerning possible efficacy of chemoprophylaxis among persons with HIV infection 
or interactions with other drugs used to manage HIV infection. Such patients should be monitored closely if 
chemoprophylaxis is administered.
</P><P><B>Other Persons</B>
</P><P>Chemoprophylaxis throughout the influenza season or during increases in influenza activity within the community might 
be appropriate for persons at high risk for whom vaccination is contraindicated, or for whom vaccination is likely to 
be ineffective. Health-care providers and patients should make decisions regarding whether to begin chemoprophylaxis and 
how long to continue it on an individual basis.

COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>04, no A (H3N2) viruses in 2004<FONT

COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>07 influenza season (CDC, unpublished data, 2007).
</P><P>In 2007<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08, increased resistance to oseltamivir was reported among A (H1N1) viruses in many countries 
(<I>469,470</I>). Persons infected with oseltamivir resistant 
A (H1N1) viruses had not previously received oseltamivir treatment and were 
not known to have been exposed to a person undergoing oseltamivir treatment 
(<I>469,470</I>). In the United States, 
approximately 10% of influenza A (H1N1) viruses, no A (H3N2) viruses, and no influenza B viruses were resistant to oseltamivir during 
the 2007<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 influenza season, and the overall percentage of influenza A and B viruses resistant to oseltamivir in the United 
States was &lt;5%. No viruses resistant to zanamivir were identified 
(<I><a href="mm5631a2.htm">417</a></I>). Oseltamivir or zanamivir continue to be the antiviral 
agents recommended for the prevention and treatment of influenza 
(<I><a href="mm5703a1.htm">418</a></I>). Although recommendations for use of 
antiviral medications have not changed, enhanced surveillance for detection of oseltamivir-resistant viruses is ongoing and will 
enable continued monitoring of changing trends over time.
</P><P>Development of viral resistance to zanamivir or oseltamivir during treatment has also been identified but does not appear 
to be frequent (<I>450,471<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>474</I>). One limited study reported that oseltamivir-resistant influenza A viruses were isolated from 
nine (18%) of 50 Japanese children during treatment with oseltamivir 
(<I>475</I>). Transmission of neuraminidase 
inhibitor-resistant influenza B viruses acquired from persons treated with oseltamivir is rare but has been documented 
(<I>476</I>). No isolates with reduced susceptibility to zanamivir have been 
reported from clinical trials, although the number of post-treatment 
isolates tested is limited (<I>451,477</I>). Only one clinical isolate with reduced susceptibility to zanamivir, obtained from 
an immunocompromised child on prolonged therapy, has been reported 
(<I>451</I>). Prolonged shedding of oseltamivir- or 
zanamivir-resistant virus by severely immunocompromised patients, even after cessation of oseltamivir treatment, has been 
reported (<I>478,479</I>).
</P><P><B>Amantadine and Rimantadine (Adamantanes)</B>
</P><P>Adamantane resistance among circulating influenza A 
viruses increased rapidly worldwide over the past several years, 
and these medications are no longer recommended for influenza prevention or treatment, although in some limited 
circumstances use of adamantanes in combination with a neuraminidase inhibitor medication might be considered (see Prevention 
and Treatment of Influenza when Oseltamivir Resistance 
is Suspected). The proportion of influenza A viral isolates submitted 
from throughout the world to the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control 
of Influenza at CDC that were adamantane-resistant increased from 0.4% during 1994<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>1995 to 12.3% during 2003<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>2004 (<I>480</I>). During the 2005<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>06 influenza season, CDC determined that 193 (92%) of 209 influenza A (H3N2) viruses 
isolated from patients in 26 states demonstrated a change at amino acid 31 in the M2 gene that confers resistance to 
adamantanes (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5502a7.htm">413</a>,414</I>). Preliminary data from the 2007<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>08 influenza season indicates that resistance to adamantanes remains high 
among influenza A isolates, with approximately 99% of tested influenza A(H3N2) isolates and approximately 10% of 
influenza A(H1N1) isolates resistant to adamantanes (CDC, unpublished data, 2008). Amantadine or rimantidine should not be 
used alone for the treatment or prevention of influenza in the United States until evidence of susceptibility to these 
antiviral medications has been reestablished among circulating influenza A viruses. Adamantanes are not effective in the prevention 
or treatment of influenza B virus infections.
</P><P><B>Prevention and Treatment of Influenza when Oseltamivir Resistance is Suspected</B>
</P><P>Testing for antiviral resistance in influenza viruses is not available in clinical settings. Because the proportion of 
influenza viruses that are resistant to oseltamivir remains &lt;5% in the United States, oseltamivir or zanamivir remain the 
medications recommended for prevention and treatment of influenza. Influenza caused by oseltamivir-resistant viruses appears to 
be indistinguishable from illness caused by 
oseltamivir-sensitive viruses (<I>469</I>). When local viral surveillance data 
indicates that oseltamivir-resistant viruses are widespread in the community, clinicians have several options. Consultation with local 
health authorities to aid in decision-making is recommended as a first step. Persons who are candidates 
for receiving chemoprophylaxis as part of an outbreak known to be caused by oseltamivir-resistant viruses or who are 
being treated for influenza illness in communities where oseltamivir-resistant viruses are known to be circulating widely 
can receive zanamivir. However, zanamivir is not licensed for chemoprophylaxis indications in children aged &lt;5 years, and is 
not licensed for treatment in children aged &lt;7 years 
(<I>451</I>). In addition, zanamivir is not recommended for use in persons 
with chronic cardiopulmonary conditions, and can be difficult to administer to critically ill patients because of the 
inhalation mechanism of delivery. In these circumstances, a combination of oseltamivir and either rimantadine or amantadine can 
be considered, because influenza A (H1N1) viruses characterized to date that were resistant to oseltamivir have usually 
been susceptible to adamantane medications (CDC, unpublished data, 2008). However, adamantanes should not be used 
for chemoprophylaxis or treatment of influenza A unless they are part of a regimen that also 
includes a neuraminidase inhibitor, because viral surveillance data has documented that adamantane resistance among influenza A viruses is common. Influenza 
B viruses are not sensitive to adamantane drugs.
</P><P><B>Control of Influenza Outbreaks in Institutions</B>
</P><P>Use of antiviral drugs for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza is a key component of influenza outbreak control 
in institutions. In addition to antiviral medications, other outbreak-control measures include instituting droplet precautions 
and establishing cohorts of patients with confirmed or suspected influenza, re-offering influenza vaccinations to 
unvaccinated staff and patients, restricting staff movement 
between wards or buildings, and restricting contact between ill staff or visitors 
and patients (<I>481<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>483</I>). Both adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors have been successfully used to control outbreaks 
caused by antiviral susceptible strains when antivirals are combined with other infection control measures. 
(<I>460,462,464,484<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>488</I>).
</P><P>When confirmed or suspected outbreaks of influenza occur in institutions that house persons at high risk, 
chemoprophylaxis with a neuraminidase inhibitor medication should be started as early as possible to reduce the spread of the virus 
(<I>489,490</I>). In these situations, having preapproved orders from physicians or plans to obtain orders for antiviral medications on short 
notice can substantially expedite administration of antiviral medications. Specimens should be collected from ill cases for viral 
culture to assess antiviral resistance and provide data on the outbreak viruses. Chemoprophylaxis should be administered to all 
eligible residents, regardless of whether they received influenza vaccinations during the previous fall, and should continue for 
a minimum of 2 weeks. If surveillance indicates that new cases continue to occur, chemoprophylaxis should be continued 
until 

approximately 7<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>10 days after illness onset in the last patient 
(<I>489</I>). Chemoprophylaxis also can be offered to 
unvaccinated staff members who provide care to persons at high risk. Chemoprophylaxis should be considered for all employees, 
regardless of their vaccination status, if indications exist that the outbreak is caused by a strain of influenza virus that is not 
well-matched by the vaccine. Such indications might include multiple documented breakthrough influenza-virus infections 
among vaccinated persons, studies indicating low vaccine effectiveness, or circulation in the surrounding community of 
suspected index case(s) of strains not contained in the vaccine.
</P><P>In addition to use in nursing homes, chemoprophylaxis also can be considered for controlling influenza outbreaks in 
other closed or semiclosed settings (e.g., dormitories, correctional facilities, or other settings in which persons live in 
close proximity). To limit the potential transmission of drug-resistant virus during outbreaks in institutions, whether in chronic 
or acute-care settings or other closed settings, measures should be taken to reduce contact between persons taking antiviral 
drugs for treatment and other persons, including those taking chemoprophylaxis.

for treatment of influenza is 2 inhalations (one 5-mg blister per inhalation for a total dose of 10 mg) twice daily 
(approximately 12 hours apart). Zanamivir is licensed for chemoprophylaxis of influenza among children aged 
<U>&gt;</U>5 years; the chemoprophylaxis dosage of zanamivir for children aged 
<U>&gt;</U>5 years is 10 mg (2 inhalations) once a day.
</P><P>Oseltamivir is licensed for treatment and chemoprophylaxis among children aged

</P><P><B>Persons with Impaired Renal Function</B>
</P><P>Limited data are available regarding the safety and efficacy of zanamivir for patients with impaired renal function. 
Among patients with renal failure who were administered a single 
intravenous dose of zanamivir, decreases in renal clearance, 
increases in half-life, and increased systemic exposure to zanamivir were reported 
(<I>450</I>). However, a limited number of healthy volunteers who were administered high doses of intravenous zanamivir tolerated systemic levels of zanamivir that 
were substantially higher than those resulting from 
administration of zanamivir by oral inhalation at the recommended 
dose (<I>491,492</I>). On the basis of these considerations, the manufacturer recommends no dose adjustment for inhaled zanamivir 
for a 5-day course of treatment for patients with either mild-to-moderate or severe impairment in renal function 
(<I>451</I>).
</P><P>Serum concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, the active metabolite of oseltamivir, increase with declining renal

a half-life of 6<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>10 hours and is excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion via the anionic 
pathway (<I>450,496</I>). Unmetabolized oseltamivir also is excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion 
(<I>468</I>).
</P><P><B>Adverse Events</B>
</P><P>When considering use of influenza antiviral medications (i.e., choice of antiviral drug, dosage, and duration of 
therapy), clinicians must consider the patient's age, weight, and renal function (<a href = "rr5707a1.htm#tab4">Table 4</a>); presence of other medical 
conditions; indications for use (i.e., chemoprophylaxis or therapy); and the potential for interaction with other medications.
</P><P><B>Zanamivir</B>
</P><P>Limited data are available about the safety or efficacy of zanamivir for persons with underlying respiratory disease or 
for persons with complications of acute influenza, and zanamivir is licensed only for use in persons without underlying 
respiratory or cardiac disease (<I>497</I>). In a study of zanamivir treatment of ILI among persons with asthma or 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in which study medication was administered after use of a B2-agonist, 13% of 
patients receiving zanamivir and 14% of patients who received placebo (inhaled powdered lactose vehicle) experienced a &gt;20% 
decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after treatment 
(<I>451,498</I>). However, in a phase-I study of persons with 
mild or moderate asthma who did not have ILI, one of 13 patients experienced bronchospasm after administration of 
zanamivir (<I>451</I>). In addition, during postmarketing surveillance, cases of respiratory function deterioration after 
inhalation of zanamivir have been reported. Because of the risk for serious adverse events and because efficacy has not been demonstrated among 
this population, zanamivir is not recommended for treatment for patients with underlying airway disease 
(<I>451</I>). Allergic reactions, including oropharyngeal or facial edema, also have been reported during postmarketing surveillance 
(<I>451,498</I>).
</P><P>In clinical treatment studies of persons with uncomplicated influenza, the frequencies of adverse events were similar 
for persons receiving inhaled zanamivir and for those receiving placebo (i.e., inhaled lactose vehicle alone) 
(<I>428<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>432,498</I>). 
The most common adverse events reported by both groups were diarrhea, nausea, sinusitis, nasal signs and symptoms, 
bronchitis, 

cough, headache, dizziness, and ear, nose, and throat infections. Each of these symptoms was reported by &lt;5% of persons 
in the clinical treatment studies combined 
(<I>451</I>). Zanamivir does not impair the immunologic response to TIV 
(<I>499</I>).
</P><P><B>Oseltamivir</B>
</P><P>Nausea and vomiting were reported more frequently among adults receiving oseltamivir for treatment (nausea 
without vomiting, approximately 10%; vomiting, approximately 9%) than among persons receiving placebo (nausea without 
vomiting, approximately 6%; vomiting, approximately 3%) 
(<I>434,435</I>,<I>450,500</I>). Among children treated with oseltamivir, 14% 
had vomiting, compared with 8.5% of placebo recipients. Overall, 1% discontinued the drug secondary to this side effect 
(<I>437</I>), and a limited number of adults who were enrolled in clinical treatment trials of oseltamivir discontinued treatment because 
of these symptoms (<I>450</I>). Similar types and rates of adverse events were reported in studies of oseltamivir 
chemoprophylaxis (<I>450</I>). Nausea and vomiting might be less severe if oseltamivir is taken with food 
(<I>450</I>). No published studies have assessed whether oseltamivir 
impairs the immunologic response to TIV.
</P><P>Transient neuropsychiatric events (self-injury or delirium) have been reported postmarketing among persons 
taking oseltamivir; the majority of reports were among adolescents and adults living in Japan 
(<I>501</I>). FDA advises that persons receiving oseltamivir be monitored closely for abnormal 
behavior (<I>450</I>).
</P><P><B>Use During Pregnancy</B>
</P><P>Oseltamivir and zanamivir are both &quot;Pregnancy Category C&quot; medications, indicating that no clinical studies have 
been conducted to assess the safety of these medications for pregnant women. Because of the unknown effects of influenza 
antiviral drugs on pregnant women and their fetuses, these two drugs should be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
benefit justifies the potential risk to the embryo or fetus; the manufacturers' package inserts should be consulted 
(<I>450,451</I>). However, no adverse effects have been reported among women who received oseltamivir or zanamivir during pregnancy or 
among infants born to such women.
</P><P><B>Drug Interactions</B>
</P><P>Clinical data are limited regarding drug interactions with zanamivir. However, no known drug interactions have 
been reported, and no clinically critical drug interactions have been predicted on the basis of in vitro and animal study 
data (<I>450,451,502</I>).
</P><P>Limited clinical data are available regarding drug interactions with oseltamivir. Because oseltamivir and 
oseltamivir carboxylate are excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion via the anionic pathway, a 
potential exists for interaction with other agents excreted by this pathway. For example, coadministration of oseltamivir and 
probenecid resulted in reduced clearance of oseltamivir carboxylate by approximately 50% and a corresponding approximate 
twofold increase in the plasma levels of oseltamivir carboxylate 
(<I>468</I>).
</P><P>No published data are available concerning the safety or efficacy of using combinations of any of these influenza 
antiviral drugs. Package inserts should be consulted for more 
detailed information about potential drug interactions.

</h3><P>Information regarding influenza surveillance, prevention, detection, and control is available at 
		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu">http://www.cdc.gov/flu</a>. During October<FONT 
COLOR="#0000ff">--</FONT>May, surveillance information is updated weekly. In addition, periodic updates regarding influenza 
are published in <I>MMWR </I>(<a href="../../../mmwr.1.html">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr</a>). Additional information regarding influenza vaccine can be obtained 
by calling 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). State and local health departments should be consulted about availability 
of influenza vaccine, access to vaccination programs, 
information related to state or local influenza activity, reporting of 
influenza outbreaks and influenza-related pediatric deaths, and advice concerning outbreak control.
</P><h3 align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Responding to Adverse Events After Vaccination</FONT></B>
</h3><P>Health-care professionals should report all clinically significant adverse events after influenza vaccination promptly 
to VAERS, even if the health-care professional is not certain that the vaccine caused the event. Clinically significant 
adverse events that follow vaccination should be reported at 
		<a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">http://www.vaers.hhs.gov</a>. Reports may be filed securely online or 
by telephone at 1-800-822-7967 to request reporting forms or other assistance.
</P><h3 align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</FONT></B>
</h3><P>The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), established by the National Childhood Vaccine 
Injury Act of 1986, as amended, provides a mechanism through which compensation can be paid on behalf of a person determined to 
have been injured or to have died as a result of receiving a vaccine covered by VICP. The Vaccine Injury Table lists the 
vaccines covered by VICP and the injuries and conditions (including death) for which compensation might be 
paid.<B> </B>If the injury or condition is not on the Table, or does not occur within the specified time period on the Table, persons must prove that 
the vaccine caused the injury or condition.
</P><P>For a person to be eligible for compensation, the general filing deadlines for injuries require claims to be filed within 3 
years after the first symptom of the vaccine injury; for a death, claims must be filed within 2 years of the vaccine-related death 
and not more than 4 years after the start of the first symptom of the vaccine-related injury from which the death occurred. When 
a new vaccine is covered by VICP or when a new 
injury/condition is added to the Table, claims that do not meet the 
general filing deadlines must be filed within 2 years from the date the vaccine or injury/condition is added to the Table for injuries 
or deaths that occurred up to 8 years before the Table change. Persons of all ages who receive a VICP-covered vaccine might 
be eligible to file a claim. Both the intranasal (LAIV) and injectable (TIV) trivalent influenza vaccines are covered under 
VICP. Additional information about VICP is available at 
		<a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation">http//www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation</a> or by calling 
1-800-338-2382.
</P><h3 align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Reporting of Serious Adverse Events After Antiviral Medications</FONT></B>
</h3><P>Severe adverse events associated with the administration of antiviral medications used to prevent or treat influenza 
(e.g., those resulting in hospitalization or death) should be reported to MedWatch, 
FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program, at telephone 1-800-FDA-1088, by facsimile at 1-800-FDA-0178, or via the Internet by sending 
Report Form 3500 (available at 
		<a href="http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/3500.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/3500.pdf</a>). Instructions regarding the types of adverse 
events that should be reported are included on MedWatch report forms.

*Children aged 6 months8 years who have never received influenza vaccine before should receive 2 doses. Those who only receive 1 dose in their first year of vaccination should receive 2 doses in the following year, spaced 4 weeks apart.
 Persons at high risk for complications of influenza infection because of underlying medical conditions should not receive LAIV. Persons at higher risk for complications of influenza infection because of underlying medical conditions include adults and children with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems; adults and children with chronic metabolic diseases (including diabetes mellitus), renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunnosuppression; children and adolescents receiving long-term aspirin therapy (at risk for developing Reye syndrome after wild-type influenza infection); persons who have any condition (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, spinal cord injuries, seizure disorders, or other neuromuscular disorders) that can compromise respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk for aspiration; pregnant women; and residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities that house persons with chronic medical conditions.
 Clinicians and vaccination programs should screen for possible reactive airways diseases when considering use of LAIV for children aged 24 years, and should avoid use of this vaccine in children with asthma or a recent wheezing episode. Health-care providers should consult the medical record, when available, to identify children aged 24 years with asthma or recurrent wheezing that might indicate asthma. In addition, to identify children who might be at greater risk for asthma and possibly at increased risk for wheezing after receiving LAIV, parents or caregivers of children aged 24 years should be asked: In the past 12 months, has a health-care provider ever told you that your child had wheezing or asthma? Children whose parents or caregivers answer yes to this question and children who have asthma or who had a wheezing episode noted in the medical record during the preceding 12 months, should not receive FluMist.
 Live attenuated influenza vaccine coadministration has been evaluated systematically only among children aged 1215 months who received measles, mumps and rubella vaccine or varicella vaccine. ** Inactivated influenza vaccine coadministration has been evaluated systematically only among adults who received pneumococcal polysaccharide or zoster vaccine." width="641" height="641"><br><a href = "rr5707a1.htm#top">Return to top.</a>

Vaccination of all children aged 6 months18 years should begin before or during the 200809 influenza season if feasible, but no later than during the 200910 influenza season. Vaccination of all children aged 518 years is a new ACIP recommendation.
Children and adolescents at high risk for influenza complications should continue to be a focus of vaccination
efforts as providers and programs transition to routinely
vaccinating all children and adolescents. Recommendations for these children have not changed. Children and adolescents at higher risk for influenza complication are those:

aged 6 months4 years;

who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, hematological or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus);

who are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression
caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus);

who have any condition (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, spinal cord injuries, seizure disorders, or other neuromuscular
disorders) that can compromise respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk for aspiration;

who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy who therefore
might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;

who are residents of chronic-care facilities; and,

who will be pregnant during the influenza season.
Note: Children aged <6 months should not receive influenza vaccination. Household and other close contacts (e.g., daycare providers) of children aged <6 months, including older children and adolescents, should be vaccinated." width="410" height="704"><br><a href = "rr5707a1.htm#top">Return to top.</a>

*Trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV). A 0.5-mL dose contains 15 mcg each of A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like, A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like, and B/Florida/4/2006-like antigens.
 Two doses administered at least 1 month apart are recommended for children aged 6 months8 years who are receiving TIV for the first time and those who only received 1 dose in their first year of vaccination should receive 2 doses in the following year.  For adults and older children, the recommended site of vaccination is the deltoid muscle. The preferred site for infants and young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.  Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). A 0.2-mL dose contains 106.57.5 fluorescent focal units of live attenuated influenza virus reassortants of each of the three strains for the 200809 influenza season: A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1), A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006.
** FluMist is shipped refrigerated and stored in the refrigerator at 2C to 8C after arrival in the vaccination clinic. The dose is 0.2 mL divided equally between each nostril. Health-care providers should consult the medical record, when available, to identify children aged 24 years with asthma or recurrent wheezing that might indicate asthma. In addition, to identify children who might be at greater risk for asthma and possibly at increased risk for wheezing after receiving LAIV, parents or caregivers of children aged 24 years should be asked: In the past 12 months, has a health-care provider ever told you that your child had wheezing or asthma? Children whose parents or caregivers answer yes to this question and children who have asthma or who had a wheezing episode noted in the medical record during the preceding 12 months, should not receive FluMist.
 Two doses administered at least 4 weeks apart are recommended for children aged 28 years who are receiving LAIV for the first time, and those who only received 1 dose in their first year of vaccination should receive 2 doses in the following year." width="641" height="389"><br><a href = "rr5707a1.htm#top">Return to top.</a>

Annual recommendations for adults have not changed. Annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for any adult who wants to reduce the risk for becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting it to others. Vaccination
also is recommended for all adults in the following
groups, because these persons are either at high risk for influenza complications, or are close contacts of persons
at higher risk:

persons aged >50 years;

women who will be pregnant during the influenza season;

persons who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, hematological or metabolic disorders (including
diabetes mellitus);

persons who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus);

persons who have any condition (e.g., cognitive dysfunction,
spinal cord injuries, seizure disorders, or other neuromuscular disorders) that can compromise respiratory
function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk for aspiration;

residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities;

health-care personnel;

 NIS uses provider-verified vaccination status to improve the accuracy of the estimate. The NIS estimate for the 200607 season will be available summer
or fall 2007. The NHIS coverage estimates based on parental report were 39.5% (95% CI: 32.846.7; n=295) for the 200506 season and 46.4% (95%
CI: 39.753.2; n=368) for the 200607 season.
** Adults categorized as being at high risk for influenza-related complications self-reported one or more of the following: 1) ever being told by a physician they had diabetes, emphysema, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; 2) having a diagnosis of cancer during the previous 12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) or ever being told by a physician they have lymphoma, leukemia, or blood cancer during the previous 12 months (Post coding for a cancer diagnosis was not yet completed at the time of this publication so this diagnosis was not include in the 200607 season data.); 3) being told by a physician they have chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys; or 4) reporting an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 12 months. For children aged <18 years, high risk conditions included ever having been told by a physician of having diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, congenital heart disease, other heart disease, or neuromuscular conditions (seizures, cerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy), or having an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 12 months.
 Aged 1844 years, pregnant at the time of the survey and without high-risk conditions.  Adults were classified as health-care workers if they were currently employed in a health-care occupation or in a health-careindustry setting, on the basis of standard occupation and industry categories recoded in groups by CDCs National Center for Health Statistics.  Data not yet available. *** Interviewed sample child or adult in each household containing at least one of the following: a child aged <5 years, an adult aged >65 years, or any person aged 517 years at high risk (see previous footnote** ). To obtain information on household composition and high-risk status of household members, the sampled adult, child, and person files from NHIS were merged. Interviewed adults who were health-care workers or who had high-risk conditions were excluded. Information could not be assessed regarding high-risk status of other adults aged 1864 years in the household, thus, certain adults 1864 years who live with an adult aged 1864 years at high risk were not included in the analysis. Also note that although the recommendation for vaccination
of children aged 24 years was not in place during the 200506 season. Children aged 24 years in these calculations were considered to have an indication for vaccination to facilitate comparison of coverage date for subsequent years." width="641" height="608"><br><a href = "rr5707a1.htm#top">Return to top.</a>
