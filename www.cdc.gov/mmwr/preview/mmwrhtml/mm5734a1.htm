<H1>Outbreak of <I>Salmonella</I> Serotype Saintpaul Infections Associated 
with Multiple Raw Produce Items --- United States, 2008</FONT></H1>
</P><P>On May 22, 2008, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) notified CDC about four persons infected 
with <I>Salmonella</I> Saintpaul strains that were indistinguishable from each other by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and 
15 other persons with <I>Salmonella</I> infections whose isolates had not yet been characterized. In the following weeks, cases 
continued to be reported, and the outbreak expanded to include 43 states, the District of Columbia 
(<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>), and Canada. This report is an interim summary of results from seven epidemiologic studies, traceback investigations, and environmental 
investigations related to the outbreak. Further data collection and analyses are ongoing. As of August 25, 2008, a total of 1,442 persons 
had been reported infected with the outbreak strain. At least 286 persons have been hospitalized, and the infection might 
have contributed to two deaths. The outbreak began late in April 2008, and most persons became ill in May or June. The 
outbreak appears to be over; however, CDC and state health departments are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of 
infection with the outbreak strain. Preliminary epidemiologic and microbiologic results to date support the conclusion that 
jalape&ntilde;o peppers were a major vehicle by which the pathogen was transmitted and serrano peppers also were a vehicle; 
tomatoes possibly were a vehicle, particularly early in the outbreak. Contamination of produce items might have occurred on the 
farm or during processing or distribution; the mechanism of contamination has not been determined. These findings indicate 
that additional measures are needed to enhance food safety and reduce illnesses from produce that is consumed raw.
<H4>
<B>Epidemiologic Studies</B>
</H4>
</P><P>A case was defined as laboratory-confirmed infection with 
<I>Salmonella</I> Saintpaul with <I>Xba</I>I pattern JN6X01.0048, 
the outbreak strain. Of the 1,442 cases reported, public health agencies have reported illness onset information for 1,414 
patients. Illnesses began during April 16--August 11; most persons became ill in May or June 
(<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Complete demographic information is available for 565 ill persons. Of these, 52% were male; 79% were white, 8% were American 
Indian/Alaska Native, 3% were black, 2% were Asian/Pacific Islander, and 7% reported other or multiple races. Hispanic ethnicity 
was reported for 22%. Patient ages ranged from &lt;1 to 99 years (median age: 33 years), and the highest incidence was among 
persons aged 20--29 years. Cases were distributed among 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada, with particularly 
high incidence rates in New Mexico and Texas (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>).
</P><P>Soon after the first cases were detected in mid-May 2008, additional cases were identified in Texas and the 
Navajo Nation through PulseNet (the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance). Nineteen ill 
persons were initially interviewed in detail to generate hypotheses about the source of their illnesses. To identify the source, 
NMDOH, the Texas Department of State Health Services (TXDSHS), Navajo Nation, the Indian Health Service (IHS), and 
CDC conducted a multistate case-control study of laboratory-confirmed infections. For this case-control study, a case was defined 
as diarrheal illness (three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) that began on or after May 1 in a person infected with 
the outbreak strain. Controls were well persons in the community matched by age and location using reverse telephone 
directories and by face-to-face interviews. The matched analysis included 51 case-patients and 106 controls. Using a questionnaire 
based on hypotheses generated by the preliminary interviews, study participants were asked about foods consumed during the 
week preceding their illness. On univariate analysis, illness was significantly associated with eating raw tomatoes (matched odds 
ratio [mOR] = 6.7) and had a borderline association with eating tortillas (mOR = 2.8) in the week preceding illness onset 
(<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>). Illness remained significantly associated with eating raw tomatoes (mOR = 5.6) after adjusting for consumption of 
tortillas (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>). Illness was not significantly associated with eating salsa (mOR = 1.7), guacamole (mOR = 1.6), or any other 
food item (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>).
</P><P>In June, increasing numbers of cases were reported from a growing number of states. State and local health 
departments identified clusters of illness in restaurants by interviewing ill persons whose isolates had the outbreak PFGE pattern and 
asking about exposures to suspect foods and about any recent meals at restaurants. Beginning on June 20, TXDSHS and 
CDC investigated a cluster of 47 ill persons associated with a Mexican-style restaurant in Texas. For this case-control study, a 
case was defined as diarrheal illness (three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) in a person who ate at the restaurant in 
the week before illness began; culture confirmation was not required. Controls were well meal companions. The analysis 
included 

47 case-patients and 36 controls. On multiple logistic regression, illness was significantly associated only with eating 
salsa (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 62.3) (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>). The salsa ingredients included raw tomatoes and raw jalape&ntilde;o peppers.
</P><P>Beginning on June 24, TXDSHS and CDC investigated another cluster of 33 ill persons, this one associated with a 
local Mexican-style restaurant chain in Texas. For this case-control study, a case was defined as diarrheal illness (three or more 
loose stools in a 24-hour period) in a person who ate at either of two restaurants in the chain during the week before illness 
began; culture confirmation was not required. Controls were well meal companions and restaurant patrons identified by credit 
card receipts. The analysis included 33 case-patients and 62 controls. Illness was significantly associated only with eating salsa 
(aOR = 7.5) (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>). The salsa ingredients included commercially canned tomatoes and raw jalape&ntilde;o peppers, but not raw 
tomatoes. These results indicated that jalape&ntilde;o peppers were a likely source of illness.
</P><P>Beginning on June 26, to further investigate possible food vehicles, CDC and state and local health departments in 29 
states conducted a second multistate case-control study of laboratory-confirmed infections identified through PulseNet. 
A case was defined as diarrheal illness (three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) that began on or after June 1 in a person 
infected with the outbreak strain. Controls were well persons in the community matched by age and location using reverse 
telephone directories. The matched analysis included 141 cases and 281 controls. After adjusting for sex, Hispanic 
ethnicity, and additional age variation, illness was significantly associated with eating at a Mexican-style restaurant in the week 
preceding illness onset (mOR = 4.6) (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>). Illness also was significantly associated with eating pico de gallo (mOR = 4.0), 
corn tortillas (mOR = 2.3), and freshly prepared salsa (mOR = 2.1) (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>). Illness was not significantly associated with 
any other individual food items or ingredients.
</P><P>Beginning on June 30, the Minnesota Department of Health investigated a cluster of 19 persons with 
<I>Salmonella</I> Saintpaul infection associated with a natural food restaurant. For this case-control study, a case was defined as diarrheal illness (three 
or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) in a person infected with the outbreak strain who ate at the restaurant in the 
week before illness began. Controls were well meal companions and restaurant patrons identified by credit card receipts. 
The analysis included 19 case-patients and 73 controls. On univariate analysis, illness was significantly associated with eating 
any of several items including salsa, guacamole, red bell peppers, cilantro, and jalape&ntilde;o peppers. Both types of peppers had 
been diced before they arrived at the restaurant. On multivariate analysis, illness was only significantly associated with eating 
raw, jalape&ntilde;o peppers (OR = 62.0) (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>). This study provided more evidence that consumption of raw jalape&ntilde;o peppers was 
a major risk factor for illness.
</P><P>Beginning on July 7, the North Carolina Division of Public Health, the Mecklenburg County Health Department, 
and CDC investigated a cluster of 13 ill persons associated with a local Mexican-style restaurant. For the case-control study, a 
case was defined as diarrheal illness (three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) in a person infected with the outbreak 
strain who ate at the restaurant in the week before illness 
began. Controls were well restaurant patrons identified by credit 
card receipts. The analysis included four case-patients and 113 controls. On multivariate analysis, illness was significantly 
associated only with eating guacamole (aOR = 8.7) (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>). The guacamole ingredients included avocado, raw Roma 
tomatoes, raw red onions, raw serrano peppers, cilantro, salt, and lime juice, but not jalape&ntilde;o peppers. This study demonstrated that not all 
of the outbreak illnesses could be linked to eating jalape&ntilde;o peppers.
</P><P>During May 22--August 7, state and local health departments in 14 states and the District of Columbia reported a total 
of 33 restaurant-associated clusters of illness. The 
median number of laboratory-confirmed cases for all clusters was four; 
26 (79%) of the 33 clusters had eight or fewer laboratory-confirmed cases. Raw jalape&ntilde;o peppers were not served in four of 
the restaurants, serrano peppers were not served in 19 restaurants, and raw tomatoes of various types were served in all 
restaurants. Of the four restaurants without raw jalape&ntilde;o peppers, two had serrano peppers.
</P><P>During July 11--25, NMDOH, the Arizona Department of Health Services, Navajo Nation, IHS, and CDC conducted 
a household-based case-control study among non-restaurant--associated cases in New Mexico, Arizona, and the Navajo 
Nation. A case-household was defined as a household with a case (defined as diarrheal illness [three or more loose stools in a 
24-hour period] beginning on or after June 1 in a person infected with the outbreak strain). Control-households were 
enrolled systematically from the same community and had no members who reported diarrheal illness on or after June 1. The 
matched analysis included 41 case-households and 107 control-households and compared the presence of specific foods in 
the household regardless of whether the respondent remembered eating them. On univariate analysis, illness in the household 
was significantly associated with having a raw jalape&ntilde;o pepper in the household (mOR = 2.9), and illness had a 
borderline 

association with having a raw serrano pepper in the household (mOR = 3.0) during the week preceding illness onset 
(<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#tab">Table</a>). Illness was not significantly associated with the presence of any other food item in the household. A concurrent 
case-control study that evaluated individual-level exposures asked the case-patient in each case-household and respondents in 
control-households about recent food exposures. This study did not identify an association between illness in the case-patients 
and eating raw jalape&ntilde;o or serrano peppers. These results suggested that at the time these illnesses were occurring, jalape&ntilde;o 
peppers and perhaps serrano peppers were likely vehicles for illness among persons not associated with a restaurant cluster, 
although persons might not have specifically recalled consuming the peppers.
<H4>
<B>Environmental and Traceback Investigations</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) traced back the processing and distribution pathway for tomatoes 
associated with several ill persons. These tracebacks did not converge onto a single packer, distributor, or growing area of 
tomatoes. Tomatoes linked to ill persons and tomatoes randomly collected from the distribution chain in several states were 
cultured; none of these cultures yielded 
<I>Salmonella</I>.<STRIKE> </STRIKE>
</P><P>FDA traced the source of the jalape&ntilde;o peppers associated with illness in the two previously described Texas 
restaurant-associated clusters to distributors in Texas that received jalape&ntilde;o peppers from Mexico. On July 21, FDA reported isolation 
of the outbreak strain from a jalape&ntilde;o pepper sample obtained from one of these distributors. The pepper likely was grown on 
a farm in Tamaulipas, Mexico (farm A); this farm also grew serrano peppers and Roma tomatoes. FDA did not isolate 
the outbreak strain from environmental samples from farm A, but did isolate the outbreak strain from a sample of serrano 
peppers and a sample of water from a holding pond used for irrigation from another farm (farm B) in Tamaulipas. Farm B also 
grew jalape&ntilde;o peppers, but not tomatoes. Farms A and B provided produce to a common packing facility in Mexico that exports 
to the United States. In addition, on July 29, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) 
reported isolation of the outbreak strain from a jalape&ntilde;o pepper collected from the household of a person in Colorado who 
had developed illness with the outbreak strain. CDPHE traced this pepper from the grocery store where it had been purchased 
to another distributor in Texas, which reportedly received jalape&ntilde;o peppers from farms in Mexico; however, the specific 
farms have not been identified.
<H4>
<B>Control Measures</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Since June 3, CDC, FDA, and public health partners have issued multiple public advisories recommending that 
consumers avoid eating certain produce items. A limited advisory recommending that consumers in New Mexico and Texas avoid 
eating certain types of tomatoes was issued on June 3, and the advisory was expanded nationwide on June 7 (<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#fig2">Figure 2</a>). After associations were identified between illness and eating jalape&ntilde;o and serrano peppers, CDC and FDA issued 
successive advisories recommending that consumers avoid eating jalape&ntilde;o and serrano peppers grown in Mexico; the 
first nationwide jalape&ntilde;o pepper advisory was issued on July 9 
(<a href = "mm5734a1.htm#fig2">Figure 2</a>). The tomato advisory was lifted on July 17; the 
jalape&ntilde;o and serrano pepper advisories remain in effect.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P><B> </B>Contaminated produce eaten raw is an increasingly recognized vehicle for transmission of 
<I>Salmonella</I> and other pathogens (<I>1</I>). Each year, approximately 36,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of 
<I>Salmonella</I> infection are reported in the 
United States through national serotype-based surveillance 
(<I>2</I>). <I>Salmonella</I> Saintpaul is an uncommon serotype, causing, on 
average, 1.6% of all reported laboratory-confirmed 
<I>Salmonella</I> infections each year. In 2007, only 40 human isolates of the outbreak 
strain were submitted to PulseNet. This report describes 
the largest foodborne disease outbreak identified in the United States in 
the past decade, based on the number of culture-confirmed cases. Because many persons with 
<I>Salmonella</I> illness do not seek care or have a stool specimen tested, many more illnesses likely have occurred than those reported 
(<I>3</I>).
</P><P>In this outbreak, epidemiologic studies revealed associations between illness and more than one raw produce item. 
Although most multistate enteric disease outbreaks have been linked to a single food vehicle, an outbreak attributed to both parsley 
and 

cilantro grown on one farm has been reported 
(<I>4</I>). The initial case-control study identified an association between illness 
and eating raw tomatoes. Subsequent studies identified an association between illness and eating raw jalape&ntilde;o peppers, an 
item commonly eaten with tomatoes in Mexican-style cuisine. Epidemiologic data also suggested an association with raw 
serrano peppers. These associations triggered product alerts and led to product tracing and microbiologic studies, which indicated 
that jalape&ntilde;o and serrano peppers grown, harvested, or packed in Mexico were contaminated with the outbreak strain. 
The epidemiologic and microbiologic results support the conclusion that jalape&ntilde;o peppers were a major vehicle by which 
the pathogen was transmitted, and that serrano peppers also were a vehicle. Consumption of peppers was not implicated in either 
of the two multistate case-control studies. However, produce items such as peppers that are typically consumed in small quantities 
as ingredients of other dishes might not be remembered and can be difficult to implicate 
(<I>5</I>). Neither raw jalape&ntilde;o nor 
serrano peppers have been identified previously as a vehicle for a foodborne disease outbreak in the United States. Little is known 
about the survival and growth characteristics of 
<I>Salmonella</I> on these peppers, although rapid growth in jalape&ntilde;o pepper 
extract has been reported (<I>6</I>).
</P><P>Tomatoes possibly were a vehicle for infection, particularly early in the outbreak. In the initial case-control study, 
illness was significantly associated with consumption of raw tomatoes and not with foods containing peppers, such as salsa 
or guacamole. Consumption of jalape&ntilde;o or serrano peppers was not assessed in this initial study because in 
hypothesis-generating interviews conducted with 19 
case-patients, only five (26%) reported eating peppers other than red or green 
bell peppers in the week before illness began. In addition, a survey of 75 case-patients in Texas whose illnesses began before June 
7, using a questionnaire that asked specifically about pepper consumption, found a relatively low proportion who reported 
eating raw jalape&ntilde;o (39%) or raw serrano (8%) peppers in the week before illness began, whereas 
reported raw tomato consumption was high (85%). Finding the outbreak strain on two types of peppers from two farms supports the possibility 
of contamination of other produce items, including tomatoes, during growing, processing, or distribution.
</P><P>Local, state, tribal, and federal response capacity often is strained during large and complex outbreaks, and structure 
and capabilities vary among jurisdictions. This can cause delays in identifying cases and in conducting investigations. In 
this outbreak investigation, the median time from illness onset to submission of the PFGE pattern of patients' 
<I>Salmonella</I> isolates to PulseNet was 17 days; 90% were submitted within 27 days. Faster transfer of bacterial strains to public health laboratories 
and faster subtyping in those laboratories would result in more timely investigation of cases of infection. 
Epidemiologic investigations can benefit from faster methods for interviewing ill and well persons, improved interview formats, and 
rapidly adaptable electronic data gathering and transmission platforms. Improvements in the ability to trace contaminated 
produce quickly and accurately also would improve the speed of investigations, the speed and specificity of recalls, and 
the determination of the ultimate causes of contamination. For several years, CDC has been improving the efficiency 
of epidemiologic investigations through OutbreakNet, the network of public health officials that investigates outbreaks of 
enteric illnesses nationwide, and through participation in the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak 
Response,* a multidisciplinary working group.
</P><P>In addition, FDA has been enhancing the safety of produce by collaborating with state officials, academia, and industry 
on multiyear initiatives to increase the safety of leafy greens and tomatoes. FDA and its partners are working to improve 
guidance and policies intended to minimize outbreaks and to improve produce-safety research and education.
