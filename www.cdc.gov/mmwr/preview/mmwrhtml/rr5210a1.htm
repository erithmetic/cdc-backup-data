<B>
</P></B><P><I>The health-care facility environment is rarely implicated in disease transmission, except among patients who 
are immunocompromised. Nonetheless, inadvertent exposures to environmental pathogens (e.g., 
</I>Aspergillus<I> spp. and </I>Legionella<I> spp.) or airborne pathogens (e.g., 

</I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<I> and varicella-zoster virus) can result in adverse 
patient outcomes and cause illness among health-care workers. Environmental infection-control strategies and engineering controls can effectively prevent these infections. The incidence of health-care--associated infections and pseudo-outbreaks can be minimized by 1) appropriate use of cleaners and disinfectants; 2) appropriate maintenance of medical equipment (e.g., 

automated endoscope reprocessors or hydrotherapy equipment); 3) adherence to water-quality standards for hemodialysis, and to ventilation standards for specialized care environments (e.g., airborne infection isolation rooms, protective environments, or operating rooms); and 4) prompt management of water intrusion into the facility. Routine environmental sampling is not 
usually advised, except for water quality determinations in hemodialysis settings and other situations where sampling is directed by epidemiologic principles, and results can be applied directly to infection-control decisions.
</P><P>This report reviews previous guidelines and strategies for preventing environment-associated infections in health-care facilities and offers recommendations. These include 1) evidence-based recommendations supported by studies; 2) requirements of federal agencies (e.g., Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of 
Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and U.S. Department of Justice); 3) guidelines and standards from 

building and equipment professional organizations (e.g., American Institute of Architects, Association for the Advancement of 
Medical Instrumentation, and American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers); 4) 
recommendations derived from scientific theory or rationale; and 5) experienced opinions based upon infection-control and engineering practices. The report also suggests a series of performance measurements as a means to evaluate infection-control efforts.</I><B>

<B>Parameters of the Report</B>
</H4>
</P></B><P>This report, which contains the complete list of recommendations with pertinent references, is Part II of <I>Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities. 

</I>The full four-part guidelines will be available on CDC's Division 
of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) website. Relative to previous CDC guidelines, this report
</P><UL>
<LI>revises multiple sections (e.g., cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces, environmental sampling, laundry and bedding, and regulated medical waste) from previous editions of CDC's 
<I>Guideline for Handwashing and Hospital Environmental 
Control</I>;

<LI>incorporates discussions of air and water environmental concerns from CDC's 
<I>Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial 
Pneumonia</I>;
<LI>consolidates relevant environmental infection-control measures from other CDC guidelines; and
<LI>includes two topics not addressed in previous CDC guidelines --- infection-control concerns related to animals in 
health-care facilities and water quality in hemodialysis settings.
</UL>
<B>
 </P></B><P>In the full guidelines, Part I, Background Information: Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities, provides 
a comprehensive review of the relevant scientific literature. Attention is given to engineering and infection-control 
concerns during construction, demolition, renovation, and repair of health-care facilities. Use of an infection-control risk assessment is strongly supported before the start of these or any other activities expected to generate dust or water aerosols. Also reviewed 

in Part I are infection-control measures used to recover from catastrophic events (e.g., flooding, sewage spills, loss of electricity and ventilation, or disruption of water supply) and the limited effects of environmental surfaces, laundry, plants, 
animals, medical wastes, cloth furnishings, and carpeting on disease transmission in health-care facilities. Part III and Part IV of the full guidelines provide references (for the complete guideline) and appendices, respectively.
</P><P>Part II (this report) contains recommendations for environmental infection control in health-care facilities, 

describing control measures for preventing infections associated with air, water, or other elements of the environment. These recommendations represent the views of different divisions within CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), a 12-member group that advises CDC on 
concerns related to the surveillance, prevention, and control of health-care--associated infections, primarily in U.S. health-care facilities. In 1999, HICPAC's infection-control focus was expanded from acute-care hospitals to all venues where health care is 
provided (e.g., outpatient surgical centers, urgent care centers, clinics, outpatient dialysis centers, physicians' offices, and skilled nursing facilities). The topics addressed in this report are applicable to the majority of health-care facilities in the United States. This report is intended for use primarily by infection-control practitioners, epidemiologists, employee health and safety 

personnel, engineers, facility managers, information systems professionals, administrators, environmental service professionals, and architects. Key recommendations include
</P><UL>
<LI>infection-control impact of ventilation system and water system performance;
<LI>establishment of a multidisciplinary team to conduct infection-control risk assessment;
<LI>use of dust-control procedures and barriers during construction, repair, renovation, or demolition;
<LI>environmental infection-control measures for special areas with patients at high risk;
<LI>use of airborne-particle sampling to monitor the effectiveness of air filtration and dust-control measures;
<LI>procedures to prevent airborne contamination in operating rooms when infectious tuberculosis (TB) patients 
require surgery;

<LI>guidance regarding appropriate indications for routine culturing of water as part of a comprehensive control program 
for legionellae;
<LI>guidance for recovering from water-system disruptions, water leaks, and natural disasters (e.g., flooding);
<LI>infection-control concepts for equipment using water from main lines (e.g., water systems for hemodialysis, ice 
machines, hydrotherapy equipment, dental unit water lines, and automated endoscope reprocessors);
<LI>environmental surface cleaning and disinfection strategies with respect to antibiotic-resistant microorganisms;
<LI>infection-control procedures for health-care laundry; 

<LI>use of animals in health care for activities and therapy; 
<LI>managing the presence of service animals in health-care facilities; 

<LI>infection-control strategies for when animals receive treatment in human health-care facilities; and
<LI>a call to reinstate the practice of inactivating amplified cultures and stocks of microorganisms onsite during medical 
waste treatment.
</UL>
<B>
 </P></B><P>Topics outside the scope of this report include 1) noninfectious adverse events (e.g., sick building syndrome), 
2) environmental concerns in the home, 3) home health care, 4) terrorism, and 5) health-care--associated foodborne illness. </P><P>Wherever possible, the recommendations in this report are based on data from well-designed scientific studies. 
However, certain of these studies were conducted by using narrowly defined patient populations or specific health-care settings (e.g., hospitals versus long-term care facilities), making generalization of findings potentially problematic. Construction 

standards for hospitals or other health-care facilities may not apply to residential home-care units. Similarly, infection-control measures indicated for immunosuppressed patient care are usually not necessary in those facilities where such patients are not present. 
</P><P>Other recommendations were derived from knowledge gained during infectious disease investigations in 
health-care facilities, where successful termination of the outbreak was often the result of multiple interventions, the majority of which cannot be independently and rigorously evaluated. This is especially true for construction situations involving air or water. </P><P>Other recommendations were derived from empiric engineering concepts and may reflect industry standards rather 
than evidence-based conclusions. Where recommendations refer to guidance from the American Institute of Architects (AIA), 

the statements reflect standards intended for new construction or renovation. Existing structures and engineered systems are expected to be in continued compliance with those standards in effect at the time of construction or renovation. 
</P><P>Also, in the absence of scientific confirmation, certain infection-control recommendations that cannot be 
rigorously evaluated are based on strong theoretic rationale and suggestive evidence. Finally, certain recommendations are derived from existing federal regulations.

<H4>
<B>Performance Measurements</B>
</H4>
</P></B><P>Infections caused by the microorganisms described in this guideline are rare events, and the effect of these 
recommendations on infection rates in a facility may not be readily measurable. Therefore, the following steps to measure performance are suggested to evaluate these recommendations:
</P>
      <ol>
<LI>Document whether infection-control personnel are actively involved in all phases of a health-care facility's 

demolition, construction, and renovation. Activities should include performing a risk assessment of the necessary types of construction barriers, and daily monitoring and documenting of the presence of negative airflow within the construction zone or renovation area.
<LI>Monitor and document daily the negative airflow in AII rooms and positive airflow in PE rooms, especially when patients are in these rooms. 
<LI>Perform assays at least once a month by using standard quantitative methods for endotoxin in water used to reprocess hemodialyzers, and for heterotrophic and mesophilic bacteria in water used to prepare dialysate and for hemodialyzer reprocessing.

<LI>Evaluate possible environmental sources (e.g., water, laboratory solutions, or reagents) of specimen contamination when nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) of unlikely clinical importance are isolated from clinical cultures. If 
environmental contamination is found, eliminate the probable mechanisms. 
<LI>Document policies to identify and respond to water damage. Such policies should result in either repair and drying of wet structural or porous materials within 72 hours, or removal of the wet material if drying is unlikely within 72 hours.

<B>Key Terms</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Airborne infection isolation (AII)  </B>refers to the isolation of patients infected with organisms spread via airborne 

droplet nuclei &lt;5 &#181;m in diameter. This isolation area receives numerous air changes per hour (ACH) (<U>&gt;</U>12 ACH for new construction as of 2001; 
<U>&gt;</U>6 ACH for construction before 2001), and is under negative pressure, such that the direction of the air flow is from the outside adjacent space (e.g., the corridor) into the room. The air in an AII room is preferably exhausted to 
the outside, but may be recirculated provided that the return air is filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The use of personal respiratory protection is also indicated for persons entering these rooms when caring for TB or 
smallpox patients and for staff who lack immunity to airborne viral diseases (e.g., measles or varicella zoster virus [VZV] infection). </P>
<B><P>Protective environment (PE)</B> is a specialized patient-care area, usually in a hospital, with a positive air flow relative to 

the corridor (i.e., air flows from the room to the outside adjacent space). The combination of HEPA filtration, high numbers of air changes per hour (<U>&gt;</U>12 ACH), and minimal leakage of air into the room creates an environment that can safely accommodate patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).<B> 
</P><P>Immunocompromised patients  </B>are those patients whose immune mechanisms are deficient because of 
immunologic disorders (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection or congenital immune deficiency syndrome), chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, cancer, emphysema, or cardiac failure), or immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti-rejection medication, or steroids). Immunocompromised patients who are identified as high-risk patients have the greatest risk of infection caused by airborne or waterborne microorganisms. Patients in this subset include persons who are severely neutropenic for prolonged periods of time (i.e., an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] of 

<U>&lt;</U>500 cells/mL), allogeneic HSCT patients, and those who have received the most intensive chemotherapy (e.g., childhood acute myelogenous leukemia patients).

<B>Rationale for Recommendations</B>

</H4>
</P></B><P>As in previous CDC guidelines, each recommendation is categorized on the basis of existing scientific data, 
theoretic rationale, applicability, and possible economic effect. The recommendations are evidence-based wherever possible. However, certain recommendations are derived from empiric infection-control or engineering principles, theoretic rationale, or from experience gained from events that cannot be readily studied (e.g., floods).
</P><P>The HICPAC system for categorizing recommendations has been modified to include a category for engineering 
standards and actions required by state or federal regulations. Guidelines and standards published by the AIA, American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and the Association for the Advancement of 
Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) form the basis of certain recommendations. These standards reflect a consensus of expert opinions and extensive consultation with agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Compliance with 
these standards is usually voluntary. However, state and federal governments often adopt these standards as regulations. For example, the standards from AIA regarding construction and design of new or renovated health-care facilities, have been adopted by reference by &gt;40 states. Certain recommendations have two category ratings (e.g., Categories IA and IC or Categories IB and IC), indicating the recommendation is evidence-based as well as a standard or regulation.
