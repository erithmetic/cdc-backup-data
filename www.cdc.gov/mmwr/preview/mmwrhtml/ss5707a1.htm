</h3><P><b>Problem:</b> Behavioral risk factors such as smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and excessive drinking 
are linked to the leading causes of death in the United States. Controlling these behavioral risk factors and 
using preventive health services (e.g., influenza vaccinations and cholesterol screenings) can reduce morbidity 
and mortality in the U.S. population substantially. Continuous monitoring both of health behaviors and of the 
use of preventive services is essential for developing health promotion activities, intervention programs, and 
health policies at the state, city, and county level.
</P><P><b>Reporting Period Covered:</b> January--December 2006.
</P><P><b>Description of the System:</b> The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, 
state-based, random-digit--dialed telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years. BRFSS collects data on health-risk behaviors and use of preventive health services related to the leading causes of 
death and disability in the United States. This report presents results for 2006 for all 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, 145 selected metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs), and 
234 corresponding counties.
</P><P><b>Results:</b> Prevalence estimates of risk behaviors, chronic conditions, and the use of preventive services 
varied substantially by state and territory, MMSA, and county. In 2006, the estimated prevalence of fair or 
poor health ranged from 11% to 33% for states and territories, from 8% to 24% for MMSAs, and from 5% to 
24% for counties. The estimated prevalence of health-care coverage ranged from 61% to 96% for states 
and territories, MMSAs, and counties. The estimated prevalence of teeth extraction among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years was lowest in Hawaii (10%) and highest in Kentucky (39%) and West Virginia (41%). The 
estimated prevalence of activity limitation as a result of physical, mental, or emotional problems ranged from 10% 
to 28% for states and territories, from 13% to 36% for MMSAs, and from 11% to 29% for counties. 
The estimated prevalence of adults who had a recent routine checkup ranged from 45% to 81% for states 
and territories, MMSAs, and counties. The estimated prevalence of annual influenza vaccination among adults 
aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years was lowest in Puerto Rico (33%) and highest in Colorado (76%). The estimated prevalence 
of pneumococcal vaccination among older adults ranged from 30% to 75% for states and territories, from 
52% to 80% for MMSAs, and from 42% to 82% for counties.
</P><P>The estimated prevalence of sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 years ranged from 38% to 84% for states and territories, MMSAs, and counties. The estimated prevalence among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 years who had a blood stool test during the preceding 2 years was lowest in Puerto Rico (5%) and highest in 
DC and Maine (33%). The estimated prevalence among women having a Papanicolaou (Pap) test during 
the preceding 3 years ranged from 72% to 89% for states and territories, from 75% to 94% for MMSAs, and 
from 75% to 95% in counties. The estimated prevalence among women aged 
<U>&gt;</U>40 years having a mammogram during the preceding 
2 years ranged from 60% to 89% for states and territories, MMSAs, and counties. 
The estimated prevalence among men aged 
<U>&gt;</U>40 years who had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test during 
the preceding 2 years was lowest in Hawaii (40%) and highest in Puerto Rico (66%). The estimated prevalence 
of 

cigarette smoking ranged from 9% to 29% for states and territories and from 6% to 31% for MMSAs 
and counties. The estimated prevalence of binge drinking was lowest in Kentucky and Tennessee (9%) and 
highest in Wisconsin (24%). The estimated prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity ranged from 11% to 41% 
for states and territories, MMSAs, and counties. Seat belt use was lowest in North and South Dakota (58%) 
and highest in California, Hawaii, and Washington (92%). The estimated prevalence among adults who 
were overweight ranged from 32% to 40% for states and territories, from 31% to 45% for MMSAs, and from 
24% to 49% for counties. The estimated prevalence of obesity ranged from 10% to 46% for states and 
territories, MMSAs, and counties. The estimated current asthma prevalence ranged from 3% to 14% for states 
and territories, MMSAs, and counties. The estimated prevalence of diabetes ranged from 2% to 13% for states 
and territories, MMSAs, and counties. The estimated prevalence of coronary heart disease among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>45 years ranged from 5% to 20% for states and territories. The estimated prevalence of a history of stroke 
history among adults aged <U>&gt;</U>45 years ranged from 2% to 10% for states and territories, MMSAs, and counties.
</P><P>I<b>nterpretation:</b> This report indicates that substantial variations in health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases 
and conditions, and the use of preventive health services exist among adults from state to state and within states 
and underscores the continued need for prevention and health promotion activities at the local, state, and 
federal levels.
</P><P><b>Public Health Action:</b> <I>Healthy People 2010 
</I>objectives have been established to monitor health behaviors 
and the use of preventive health services. Local and state health departments and federal agencies use BRFSS 
data to measure progress toward achieving national and local health objectives. Continued surveillance is needed 
to design, implement, and evaluate public health policies and programs that can lead to a reduction in 
morbidity and mortality from the effects of health-risk behaviors and subsequent chronic conditions.
		<h3 align="center"><B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Introduction</FONT></B>
</h3>
</H3>
</P><P>The leading causes of death in the United States include chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease and cancer), injuries 
(e.g., suicides and accidents), and preventable infectious diseases (e.g., influenza and pneumonia) 
(<I>1</I>). The risk factors associated with the leading causes of death include personal health behaviors (e.g., cigarette smoking) and nonuse 
of health services (e.g. cancer screenings) 
(<I>2</I>). The estimated prevalence of these risk factors varies across the United 
States, and constant surveillance is necessary to identify groups at 
highest risk.
</P><P>The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, state-based surveillance system that is used 
to monitor progress in achieving national health goals and to direct the public health making decision process. BRFSS 
has been a source of data since 1984 and is the largest 
continuously conducted telephone survey in the world. 
Because of the large sample size, estimates are available for 53 states and territories and for 145 metropolitan and 
micropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs) and 234 counties across the United States.
</P><P><I>Healthy People 2010 </I>objectives have been established to monitor health behaviors and the use of preventive 
health services. Communities that achieve these goals are expected to 
attain decreased morbidity and premature mortality 
by preventing associated risk factors (<I>3</I>). This report contains comparisons between 2006 BRFSS data and 
<I>Healthy People 2010 </I>objectives.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Methods</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>In 2006, BRFSS was conducted in all 50 states, the District of 
Columbia (DC), Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. BRFSS uses a multistage sampling design based on random-digit--dialing methods to select a 
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years in each state and territory. The primary focus 
of BRFSS is to monitor the use of preventive services and the health behaviors and conditions that are linked with 
the leading causes of death. Details on the design, 
random sampling procedures, and reliability and validity of measures 
used in BRFSS have been described previously 
(<I>4</I>).
<H4>
<B>Questionnaire</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The 2006 BRFSS questionnaire contained three components: 1) standardized core questions asked of all 
study respondents in all states and territories, 2) optional modules containing standardized questions on specific 
health-related topics that states and territories could select to include in their surveys, and 3) additional questions developed for 
and used by one or more states and territories to address specific health-care concerns.
</P><P>The core questions addressed demographics, health status, number of healthy days, access to health care, 
physical activity, diabetes, oral health, cardiovascular disease, asthma, disabilities, tobacco/cigarette use, veteran's status, 
alcohol consumption, adult influenza immunization, slips and falls, seatbelt use, drinking and driving, women's health 
issues, prostate cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, 
human immunodeficiency virus/acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and emotional support and life satisfaction. The state-optional modules included sets 
of questions related to diabetes (selected by 48 states), anxiety and 
depression (41 states), random child selection (39 states), childhood asthma prevalence (38 states), secondhand smoke policy (22 states), folic acid (15 states), 
adult asthma history (14 states), sexual violence (13 states), child influenza vaccine supplement (nine states), intimate 
partner violence (nine states), visual impairment and access to eye care (nine states), family planning (eight states), 
general preparedness (four states), number of healthy days (four states), indoor air quality (two states), reactions to race 
(two states), and home environment (one state).
</P><P>This report focuses on 1) health status indicators (health-care coverage, oral health, and disability), 2) 
health-risk behaviors (no leisure-time physical activity, current cigarette smoking, binge drinking, and seat belt use), 3) 
preventive practices (i.e., recent routine checkup; influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations for persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years; and use of preventive health screenings for cancer [Papanicolaou (Pap) test, mammogram, colorectal cancer 
screening [sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and blood stool test], and prostate cancer screening [prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
test]), 4) chronic conditions (prevalence of diabetes, asthma, and adults who were overweight or obese), and 5) 
cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease [CHD] and a 
history of stroke).
<H4>
<B>Data Collection and Processing</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Trained interviewers administer BRFSS using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system. Data 
are collected monthly by each state and territory. After the monthly interviewing cycle ends, data are submitted to 
CDC, which checks the data for reliability.
<H4>
<B>Data Weighting</B>
</H4>
</P><P>At the end of the survey year, CDC edits and aggregates the monthly data files to create a yearly sample for each 
state. For this analysis, each sample was weighted to the respondent's probability of selection and to the age- and 
sex-specific population or age-, sex-, and race-specific population data using the 2006 census projections reported by the 
Census Bureau for each state. These sampling weights were used to calculate state-, MMSA-, and county-level 
prevalence estimates. MMSAs used in this report were those defined by the Office of Management and Budget. Respondents 
were assigned to a particular MMSA on the basis of their Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) county 
code. Detailed weighting and analytic methodologies have been documented previously 
(<I>4</I>).
<H4>
<B>Statistical Analyses</B>
</H4>
</P><P>SAS<SUP>&#174;</SUP> and 
SUDAAN<SUP>&#174;&#160;</SUP>(release 9.0.1; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) were used 
in the analyses to account for the complex sampling design and calculate prevalence estimates, standard errors, and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) (<I>5,6</I>). Statistics were not reported if the unweighted sample size for the denominator was 
&lt;50 or the CI half width was &gt;10. Only MMSAs with 
<U>&gt;</U>500 respondents or <U>&gt;</U>19 respondents per weighting class 
were included. Counties were excluded if the estimated population was 
<U>&lt;</U>10,000 persons. Responses coded as &quot;do not 
know&quot; or &quot;refused&quot; were excluded from the analyses.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Results</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P> In 2006, a total of 355,710 interviews were completed. Data were collected from all 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This report presents results 
for 2006 from 145 selected MMSAs and 234 
corresponding counties. The number of interviews completed ranged from 1,953 in Alaska to 22,973 in Washington (median: 
5,292), and the Council of American Survey and Research Organization (CASRO) response rates ranged from 35.1% in 
New Jersey to 66.0% in Nebraska (median: 51.4%).
<H4>
<B>Health Indicators</B>
</H4>
</P><P>
<B>Health Status</B>
</P><P>Respondents were asked to rate their general health as poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent. Respondents 
were classified into two groups: those who reported fair or poor health and those who reported good, very good, or 
excellent health. In 2006, the estimated prevalence of fair or poor health among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years ranged from 10.8% (95% CI = 9.8%--11.8%) in Minnesota to 32.9% (95% CI = 31.4%--34.4%) in Puerto Rico (median: 14.7%) (<a href = "ss5707a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). Among selected MMSAs, the estimated prevalence among respondents who had fair or poor health ranged from 
8.2% (95% CI = 7.0%--9.4%) in Burlington-South Burlington, Vermont to 24.3% (95% CI = 16.2%--32.4%) 
in Huntington-Ashland, West Virginia-Kentucky-Ohio (median: 14.4%) (<a href = "ss5707a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). Among selected counties, 
the estimated prevalence ranged from 5.1% (95% CI = 2.4%--7.8%) in Douglas County, Colorado to 24.0% 
(95% CI = 17.7%--30.3%) in Franklin County, 
Washington (median: 13.9%) (<a href = "ss5707a1.htm#tab3">Table 3</a>).
</P><P>
<B>Health-Care Coverage</B>
</P><P>Health-care coverage was defined as respondents having reported that they had private health insurance, prepaid 
plans (e.g., health maintenance organizations) or government health plans (e.g., Medicare or Medicaid). In 2006, 
the estimated prevalence among adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years who had health-care coverage ranged from 70.2% (95% CI = 
68.2%--72.2%) in the U.S. Virgin Islands to 92.4% (95% CI = 91.4%--93.4%) in Puerto Rico (median: 85.5%) 
(<a href = "ss5707a1.htm#tab4">Table 4</a>). Among selected MMSAs, the estimated prevalence ranged from 60.9% (95% CI = 55.6%--66.2%) in El Paso, Texas 
to 93.8% (95% CI = 91.3%--96.3%) in Nassau-Suffolk, New York (median: 86.3%) (<a href = "ss5707a1.htm#tab5">Table 5</a>). Among selected 
counties, the estimated prevalence ranged from 60.9% (95% CI = 55.6%--66.2%) in El Paso County, Texas to 96.1% (95% CI 
= 93.7%--98.5%) in Howard County, Maryland (median: 86.8%) (<a href = "ss5707a1.htm#tab6">Table 6</a>).
</P><P>
<B>Oral Health-Teeth Extraction</B>
</P><P>Oral health status was assessed by asking respondents aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years, &quot;How many of your permanent teeth have 
been removed because of tooth decay or gum disease?&quot; In 2006, the estimated prevalence among adults aged

2.1% (95% CI = 1.0%--3.2%) in Barre, Vermont to 8.7% (95% CI = 5.2%--12.2%) in Riverside-San 
Bernardino-Ontario, California (median: 4.4%) (<a href = "ss5707a1.htm#tab65">Table 65</a>). Among selected counties, the estimated prevalence ranged from 1.5% in 
New York County, New York (95% CI = 0.2%--2.8%) and Harris County, Texas (95% CI = 0.4%--2.6%) to 9.7% (95%

</H3>
</P><P>The findings in this report indicate variations in the estimated prevalence of health-risk behaviors, chronic 
diseases, and use of preventive screening practices among U.S. adults at the state and territory, MMSA, and county level. 
These variations might reflect differences in the demographic factors of respondents, including age, race, and sex distribution 
of the population; socioeconomic conditions; availability and access to health-care services; state and 
local ordinances, and patterns of reimbursement for preventive services. The results 
provided<B> </B>in this report were estimated on the basis 
of survey results and might be different than those derived by other methods. 
Multiple<B> </B>methods are available to estimate prevalence at the local level. State and local public health authorities can use BRFSS data to plan, direct, 
implement, and monitor the effectiveness of intervention strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality.
</P><P><I>Healthy People 2010 </I>objectives have been established for certain health behaviors 
(<I>3</I>). The data presented in this report can be compared with these goals to measure progress toward meeting the national objectives (<a href = "ss5707a1.htm#tab67">Table 67</a>). 
The comparisons are a general assessment because many states have established their own public health goals for 2010 
that utilize various data sources.
<H4>
<B>Health Indicators</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Although health status is measured using a single question, this concept is complex and has been demonstrated 
to predict both mortality and clinical events 
(<I>7,8</I>). In 2006, the proportion of adults who reported fair or poor 
health varied from 5.1% in Douglas County, Colorado to 32.9% in Puerto Rico.
</P><P>Because health insurance coverage is strongly associated with access to preventive care, lack of health 
insurance often leads to adverse health outcomes 
(<I>9</I>). The <I>Healthy People 2010 
</I>objective<I> </I>for health insurance coverage (objective 
no. 1-1) is 100%; no state and territory, MMSA, or county achieved this goal in 2006. According to BRFSS 
weighted estimates for 2006, approximately 35 million adults in the United States do not have health insurance.
</P><P>Extraction of all natural teeth is considered an endpoint influenced by the incidence of dental caries 
and/or periodontal disease earlier in life. As is the case with other health indicators, teeth extraction is strongly associated 
with socioeconomic status (<I>10</I>). In 2006, a total of 68% of states and territories, 76% of MMSAs, and 84% of 
counties achieved the <I>Healthy People 2010 
</I>objective<I> </I>of <U>&lt;</U>22% of adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years having lost or had all of their natural 
teeth extracted (objective no. 21-4).
</P><P>Persons with chronic diseases often experience some type of disability as their disease progresses. The estimated 
prevalence of disabilities that inhibit the normal activities of daily living emphasizes the need for better disease prevention 
and management and for better allocation of resources 
(<I>11</I>). In 2006, the proportion of adults who experienced 
limited activities because of physical, mental, or emotional 
problems ranged from 10.1% in the U.S. Virgin Islands to 35.8% 
in Huntington-Ashland, West Virginia-Kentucky-Ohio.
<H4>
<B>Preventive Practices</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes 
require multifaceted interventions that address health 
behaviors and recommended screenings. Routine checkups in primary care settings not only provide various screenings for 
chronic diseases, but also present opportunities for lifestyle interventions 
(<I>12</I>). In 2006, the percent of adults who visited 
a doctor for a routine checkup in the past year ranged from 45.4% in Utah County, Utah to 80.9% in 
Providence County, Rhode Island.
</P><P>Adults aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years are at increased risk for hospitalization and death as a result of acute respiratory illnesses 
caused by influenza and pneumonia, both of which can be prevented through vaccination. Vaccination coverage can 
be improved by providing education to the public and 
encouraging health-care providers to offer the pneumonia 
vaccine year round (<I><a href="mm5539a2.htm">13</a></I>). Only one community (Howard County, Maryland) was able to achieve the 
<I>Healthy People 2010 </I>objective<I> </I>of 
<U>&gt;</U>90% of adults aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years receiving the influenza vaccine (objective no. 14-29a). No states 
and territories, MMSAs, or counties achieved the goal for pneumonia vaccination 
(<U>&gt;</U>90%) (objective no. 14-29b).
<H4>
<B>Cancer Prevention</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths; an estimated 50%--60% of these deaths 
could be prevented if all persons aged <U>&gt;</U>50 years were screened as recommended 
(<I>14</I>). The <I>Healthy People 2010 
</I>objective<I> </I>for persons aged <U>&gt;</U>50 years who had ever received a sigmoidoscopy was 50% (objective no. 3-12). In 2006, 
approximately 95% of state/territories, MMSAs, and counties accomplished this goal. The 
<I>Healthy People </I>2010 objective for persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>50 years who had a blood stool test during the preceding 2 years was 33% (objective no. 3-12); no state 
or territory, 15 MMSAs, and 27 counties achieved this goal.
</P><P>A Pap test is used to detect abnormal or cancerous cells in the cervix. Because of the increased use of the Pap 
test, cervical cancer incidence and mortality have declined in the United States 
(<I>15</I>). The <I>Healthy People 2010 
</I>objective<I> </I>for Pap test screening during the preceding 3 years for women aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years is 90% (objective no. 3-11b). Although 
no states or territories reached this goal in 2006, approximately 15% of MMSAs and counties have achieved this goal.
</P><P>Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Mammogram 
screenings are used to detect breast cancer early, thus improving the chances of successful treatment 
(<I>16</I>). The <I>Healthy People 2010 
</I>objective<I> </I>for women aged <U>&gt;</U>40 years who had received a mammogram during the preceding 2 years is 70% 
(objective no. 3-13). Approximately 90% of states and territories, MMSAs, and counties achieved this goal in 2006.
</P><P>Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. No scientific 
consensus exists that the PSA screening test is beneficial 
(<I>17</I>). In 2006, the estimated proportion of men aged 
<U>&gt;</U>40 years who had a PSA test during the preceding 2 years ranged from 39.5% in San 
Francisco-Oakland-Fremont, California to 71.7% in Ocean County, New Jersey.
<H4>
<B>Health Risk Behaviors</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Cigarette smoking is the single most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States 
(<I>18</I>).The list of diseases caused by cigarette smoking has 
expanded to include numerous types of cancers, several cardiovascular 
and respiratory diseases, reproductive effects, cataracts, and low bone density 
(<I>18</I>). Health consequences of secondhand smoke include pediatric respiratory problems, CHD, and lung cancer in adults 
(<I>19</I>). The <I>Healthy People 2010 
</I>objective for smoking is <U>&lt;</U>12% (objective no. 27-1a) and was achieved by two states, one territory, six MMSAs, and 12 counties 
in 2006.
</P><P>Binge drinking might cause impulsive behavior that can lead to risky sexual activity, injuries, and suicide 
(<I>20,21</I>). Binge drinking over a long period of time can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and other chronic conditions 
(<I>22</I>). In 2006, a total of 13 states and territories and approximately 30% of MMSAs and counties achieved the 
<I>Healthy People 2010 </I>objective<I> </I>of 
<U>&lt;</U>13.4% of adults reporting binge drinking (objective no. 26-11c).
</P><P>Physical activity is beneficial for adults of all ages and is associated with improved health-related quality of life 
(<I>23</I>). Certain individual and societal barriers might prevent participation in the recommended level of physical activity. 
To improve this situation, communities must work to 
encourage a more active lifestyle (<I>24</I>). The 
<I>Healthy People 2010 </I>objective<I> </I>for prevalence of no leisure time physical activity is 
<U>&lt;</U>20% (objective no. 22-1) and was achieved 
by approximately 20% of states and territories and over 35% of MMSAs and counties in 2006.
</P><P>Seat belt use in the United States has risen substantially during the preceding three decades and illustrates how 
public policy can be successful in changing behavior. Laws and types of enforcement vary by state and studies have shown 
that increased spending on police and safety programs enhances seat belt use 
(<I>25</I>). Although no states and territories met 
the <I>Healthy People 2010 </I>objective of 92% for seat belt use (objective no. 15-19) in 2006, a total of 11 MMSAs and 
17 counties reached the goal.
<H4>
<B>Chronic Diseases</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Obesity increases the risk for developing serious chronic diseases. The problem involves a complex interaction 
of lifestyle patterns and calls for pervasive intervention programs at the community level 
(<I>26</I>). Among selected counties, the estimated prevalence among adults 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years who were overweight ranged from 23.6% to 48.7% and the 
estimated prevalence of obesity ranged from 9.8% to 45.5% (obesity prevalence is calculated for adults aged 
<U>&gt;</U>20 years to match with <I>Healthy People 2010 
</I>objectives). The <I>Healthy People 2010 
</I>objective<I> </I>for obesity (<U>&lt;</U>15%) was achieved by no 
states and territories, two MMSAs, and five counties in 2006 (objective no. 19-2).
</P><P>Asthma is a chronic condition that can be 
life-threatening if not properly treated. Asthma in U.S. adults accounted 
for an estimated 14.5 million lost work days in 2004, and prescription drugs cost approximately $6 billion annually 
(<I>27</I>). In 2006, the estimated current asthma prevalence among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years ranged from 3.0% in Somerset 
County, New Jersey to 13.8% in Lorain County, Ohio.
</P><P>Adults who have received a diagnosis of diabetes are at risk for developing various complications, including 
heart disease, stroke, blindness, and kidney disease. These complications can be prevented by controlling blood glucose 
levels and receiving proper preventive care 
(<I>28</I>). In 2006, the estimated diabetes prevalence among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years ranged from 2.4% in Summit County, Utah to 12.9% in Gaston County, North Carolina.
<H4>
<B>Cardiovascular Disease</B>
</H4>
</P><P>CHD can lead to a heart attack and might eventually cause heart failure. Angina or chest pain is the most 
common symptom of CHD. The prevention and treatment of CHD is complex and widely studied; common risk factors such 
as high cholesterol, physical inactivity, and smoking typically are addressed 
(<I>29</I>). In 2006, the estimated prevalence of CHD among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>45 years ranged from 5.2% in the U.S. Virgin Islands to 21.6% in 
Huntington-Ashland, West Virginia--Kentucky--Ohio.
</P><P>Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and is the leading cause of serious long-term 
disability. Stroke mortality rates are higher among blacks compared with whites, and the southeastern United States has 
the highest stroke death rate in the country 
(<I>30</I>). Among states and territories, the estimated prevalence among persons 
aged <U>&gt;</U>45 years with a history of stroke ranged from 3.0% in Puerto Rico to 7.7% in Alabama.
<H4>
<B>Limitations</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to several limitations. First, only households with land-line telephones 
are included in the survey sample; cell phone--only households and households without telephones are excluded. 
Response rates continue to decline because of changes in telecommunication usage (e.g., increases in the number of 
cell-phone only households and telephone number portability). CDC is monitoring the effect of changes in 
telecommunication usage by conducting research on sampling cell-phone numbers, sending prenotification letters, reaching 
respondents that speak languages other than English and Spanish, and multiple-mode data-collection techniques. Second, 
BRFSS data are self-reported and are subject to recall bias and social desirability effects. Despite these limitations, BRFSS 
data have been demonstrated to provide valid and reliable estimates when compared with national household surveys in 
the United States (<I>31,32</I>). BRFSS is a cost-effective 
and timely method for collecting state and local data, and often is 
the only data source available to communities to assess local health conditions and track progress.
<H4>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The findings in this report indicate the need to strengthen efforts in health promotion and disease 
prevention programs and policies. BRFSS data are used at the state and local level to renew and maintain efforts to prevent 
the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States and to monitor progress trends toward achieving 
<I>Healthy People 2010</I> objectives.
