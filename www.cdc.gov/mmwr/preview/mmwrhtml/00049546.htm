<h1>Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome -- Chile, 1997 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) * was first recognized in
Chile in October 1995; through July 1997, nine cases had been
identified in the country. However, during August 1-October 8,
1997, a total of 12 persons with HPS, including two family
clusters, were recognized. A collaborative investigation is under
way to determine the magnitude of this outbreak, the associated
rodent reservoir for hantaviruses, and the major risk factors for
human infection. This report summarizes the preliminary results of
the ongoing investigation, which suggest that the outbreak among
humans is paralleled by exceptionally high densities of potential
rodent reservoir species. </p>
<p>From October 4, 1995, through October 8, 1997, a total of 21
HPS case patients were identified in Chile; 13 died (case-fatality
proportion: 62%). The mean age of patients was 26 years (range: 1
year 11 months to 41 years); four (19%) of the cases were in
children aged less than 17 years; 76% of cases were in males. No
cases occurred among health-care workers. The outbreak that began
in August 1997 is centered in two southern regions of Chile
(population: 1.1 million). Genetic sequencing of material amplified

from the autopsy tissue of one case-patient presumptively infected
in one of these two regions identified Andes virus as the etiologic

agent (2). Clinical features have been similar to those reported in

North America (3) but have included at least three children with
petechiae. </p>
<p>The first family cluster (cluster 1) of HPS was reported from
Cisne Medio, Lago Verde community, Aysen region. On July 15, a
39-year-old man (index case) had onset of an acute febrile
respiratory illness; he died on July 21, but no appropriate
specimens were available for laboratory diagnosis of HPS. Except
for a brief visit to the family's house on July 27 to retrieve
personal belongings, family members moved to a house in a village
4.4 miles (7 km) away. Onsets of laboratory-confirmed cases of HPS
occurred in the index case-patient's wife (August 2), 2-year-old
son (August 9), 12-year-old son (August 18), and his brother-in-law

(who intermittently stayed in the original residence) (September
5). The second family cluster (cluster 2) included three of the
four members of a household in Lago Atravesado, Coyhaique
community, Aysen region. All case-patients had onsets of illness
during August 23-28. </p>
<p>A total of 569 rodent traps were placed at the original
residence of cluster 1 (on the night of August 27), at the
residence of cluster 2 (on the nights of August 28 and 29), at two
neighboring controls (within 889 yards {800 m}) of each
case-household, and in a forested area near Lago Atravesado.
Trapping yielded 253 rodents, of which 119 (47%) were Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus; the remainder primarily were Akodon olivaceous and
Akodon (Abrothrix) longipilus. High trap success in the forested
area (22 {55%} captures in 40 traps) indicated that high rodent
densities were not restricted to peridomestic areas. The overall
trap success in the Aysen region was approximately five times that
achieved 375 miles (600 km) north in Paillaco, 21.9 miles (35 km)
southwest of Valdivia (49 {10%} of 478 traps). </p>

 </p><h3>Editorial Note</h3>
<p>Editorial Note: Since its initial description in 1993, HPS has been

established as a pan-American zoonosis (4). The basic clinical
features in humans include fever, headache, myalgia, and
gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by noncardiogenic pulmonary
edema, cardiovascular collapse, and a 40%-60% case-fatality
proportion. HPS results from infection with New World hantaviruses
that are maintained by a single rodent reservoir species belonging
to the subfamily Sigmodontinae (Order: Rodentia; Family: Muridae).
Infection and disease in humans can occur after exposure to
aerosols of secretions and excretions from infected rodents.
Approximately 400 cases have been detected throughout the Americas,

with retrospective cases identified as early as 1959. Although most

cases occur sporadically in areas with endemic disease throughout
the Americas, periodic outbreaks, such as the current episode in
Chile, intermittently occur in association with meteorologic and
ecologic conditions that facilitate increased rodent densities and
contact of rodents with humans. </p>
<p>Compared with features of HPS in the United States,
distinctive features of the outbreak in Chile include the high
proportion of cases among children and the common occurrence of a
bleeding diathesis (3,4). The high trap success in Chile reflects
the high population densities of rodents, especially O.
longicaudatus, the species provisionally identified as the
reservoir of Andes virus in southern Argentina (5). In previous
outbreaks in Argentina, person-to-person transmission of Andes
virus was documented (6,7). Although person-to-person transmission
cannot be excluded as a factor for cluster 1, the high rodent
population levels probably were associated with an increased
frequency of human-rodent contact and, therefore, an increased risk

for transmission of rodentborne hantaviruses to humans. Additional
studies are being conducted to determine the major risk factors for

human infection. This multidisciplinary investigation is coupled
with training in specialized diagnostic techniques at CDC, training

in rodent sampling protocols in the field, and transfer of
diagnostic capability to Chile. Interim measures initiated by the
Ministry of Health and the regional health services include a
public health education campaign about methods for reducing rodent
contact (8). </p>
