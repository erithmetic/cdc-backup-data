<H1>Update: Recall of Dry Dog and Cat Food Products Associated with 
Human <I>Salmonella</I> Schwarzengrund Infections --- United States, 2008</FONT></H1>
</P><P>On May 16, 2008, CDC reported on a 2006--2007 multistate outbreak of infection with 
<I>Salmonella enterica</I> serotype Schwarzengrund that was associated with dry dog food 
(<I><a href="mm5719a4.htm">1</a></I>). At the time of that report, a total of 70 cases had been 
reported from 19 states, with the last case identified on October 1, 2007. Subsequently, an additional case was identified on 
December 29, 2007. Epidemiologic and environmental investigations have suggested the source of the outbreak was dry pet 
food produced by one manufacturer, Mars Petcare US. This report updates the previous CDC report, provides 
additional epidemiologic findings, and describes additional actions taken by public health agencies and the manufacturer. In 2008, 
eight more cases have been reported, bringing the total number of cases in the outbreak to 79. On September 12, 2008, 
the company announced a nationwide voluntary recall of all dry dog and cat food products produced during a 5-month period 
at one Pennsylvania plant.* Dry pet food has a 1-year shelf life. Contaminated products identified in recalls might still be in 
the homes of purchasers and could cause illness. Persons who have these products should not use them to feed their pets 
but should discard them or return them to the store.
</P><P>During 2006--2007, CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and multiple state health departments 
investigated reports to PulseNet<SUP>&#134;</SUP> of persons infected with a strain of 
<I>S.&#160;S</I>chwarzengrund with an indistinguishable pulsed-field 
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) 
pattern.<SUP>&#167;</SUP> A case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed infection with the outbreak strain 
of <I>S.&#160;S</I>chwarzengrund in a person residing in the United States who either had symptoms beginning on or after January 1, 
2006, or (if the symptom onset date was unknown) had 
<I>S.&#160;S</I>chwarzengrund isolated from a specimen on or after January 1, 
2006. Investigators initially identified 70 cases, mostly in children. As a result of these findings, on August 21, 2007, Mars 
Petcare US (referred to as manufacturer A in the May 16, 2008 report) announced voluntary recalls of selected sized bags of 
two brands of dry dog food, both manufactured by the company at its plant in Everson, Pennsylvania. The recall was based 
on microbiologic testing by FDA, which found unopened bags of the two brands contaminated with the outbreak strain. 
Other brands of dry dog and cat food produced at the same facility were not included in that recall. The Everson, 
Pennsylvania, facility ceased operations during July--November 2007 to enable cleaning, disinfection, and renovation, and resumed 
normal operations in mid-November 2007.
</P><P>Despite the 2007 recall, the outbreak strain of 
<I>S.S</I>chwarzen-grund was isolated from eight more ill persons during 
January--October 2008 (<a href = "mm5744a2.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>), bringing the total number of cases to 79 in 21 states (<a href = "mm5744a2.htm#fig2">Figure 2</a>). The ill persons were residents 
of Pennsylvania (three), Georgia (two), New York (two), and Texas (one). The last reported specimen collection date 
was September 18, 2008. The only connection between the ill persons was infection with the outbreak strain; they shared 
no household or family contacts.
</P><P>Among the eight ill persons, five were female. Among the seven whose age was available, the median age was 8 
months (range: 4 months--39 years); six persons were aged 
<U>&lt;</U>2 years. Of five ill persons for whom clinical information was available, 
all five had visited a health-care professional, two had bloody diarrhea (no information on symptoms was available for the 
other three), and one had been hospitalized. No deaths were reported. Of six households with pet ownership known, all six had 
pets (i.e., dogs, cats, or both), but no illness was reported in any pet. Pets in three households were being fed a brand of dry 
pet food known to be produced at the Everson plant. Investigators collected seven dog stool specimens and two samples of 
dry dog food from the homes of two Pennsylvania patients. None of the stool specimens or dog food samples tested positive 
for <I>Salmonella</I>. Bag lot numbers and &quot;best by&quot; 
dates could not be examined in these households because the dog food had been 
poured into plastic containers and the bags discarded. Consequently, investigators could not be certain that the dog food from the 
two households had been produced at the Everson plant, and, if so, whether the dog food had been produced after the plant was 
reopened in November 2007 or earlier.
</P><P>After additional outbreak-linked illnesses were identified in 2008, FDA conducted another investigation. In August 
2008, FDA found the outbreak strain of 
<I>S.&#160;S</I>chwarzengrund in multiple brands of finished product at the plant, prompting 
another recall of products by Mars Petcare US. On September 12, the company announced a nationwide voluntary recall of all dry 
dog and cat food products produced at the Everson plant from February 18 to July 29, 2008, when production again 
was suspended at the plant. In addition, Mars Petcare US has taken steps to ensure that recalled products are no longer on 
store shelves. On October 1, the company announced that the Everson plant would be closed permanently. The FDA 
investigation is continuing.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P></B> This outbreak of human 
<I>Salmonella</I> Schwarzengrund infections has continued over a 3-year period, 
likely because of continued contamination in the Everson, Pennsylvania, pet food production facility. 
<I>S.&#160;S</I>chwarzengrund is a rare serotype of 
<I>Salmonella</I>. Although the outbreak PFGE pattern is the most common 
<I>S.&#160;S</I>chwarzengrund PFGE pattern in the PulseNet database, isolates with that pattern made up only 20 (4%) of the 498 
<I>S.&#160;S</I>chwarzengrund isolates from humans submitted to PulseNet during 1999--2005, suggesting that the illnesses described in this report resulted from a 
common source.
</P><P>Considering the wide distribution of these products and the relatively small number of cases, the attack rate for 
this outbreak appears to be low. However, only an estimated 3% of all 
<I>Salmonella</I> infections in the United States are 
laboratory confirmed and reported to surveillance systems 
(<I>2</I>). A low attack rate supports the hypothesis that infection might 
have resulted from practices in a limited number of households that brought humans into contact with the contaminated pet 
food and led to amplification of the organisms (e.g., cross-contamination in the kitchens or irregular cleaning of pet food 
bowls that might promote bacteria growth). In addition, the strain might primarily affect persons (e.g., young children) who 
are more susceptible to lower infective doses.
</P><P>This outbreak is the first documented outbreak to associate human 
<I>Salmonella</I> infections with contaminated dry dog 
food and to trace human illness to a contaminated pet food plant. The original source of contamination and mechanisms 
for continued contamination in the Everson plant over a 3-year period are unknown. The absence of cases during 
January--March 2008 suggests that cleaning and disinfection of the plant might have had some effect. FDA is working with Mars Petcare 
US to better understand this problem.
</P><P>Since 2006, at least 13 recall announcements involving 135 pet products (e.g., dry dog food and cat food, pet treats, 
raw diets, and pet supplements) have been issued because of 
<I>Salmonella</I> contamination.<SUP>&#182;</SUP> These recalls have resulted 
from contamination with multiple serotypes of 
<I>Salmonella</I> and have been associated with multiple pet food manufacturing plants 
in the United States. Pet products typically are recalled after product testing indicates contamination with 
<I>Salmonella</I>. To date, no human illness has been associated with these other pet food recalls.
</P><P>Although the last reported case in this outbreak was tested on September 18, 2008, additional cases might occur. 
The September 2008 recall involved approximately 23,109 tons of dry pet foods, representing 105 brands. However, dry pet 
food has a 1-year shelf life,<B> </B>and contaminated product might still be in the homes of purchasers and could produce illness.
</P><P>State and local health departments that identify ill persons with the outbreak strain should query ill persons or 
their caregivers to find out about pet-related exposures, including brands of dry pet food used in the home. When possible, 
pet 

stool specimens and samples of dry pet food should be collected and submitted for laboratory testing. 
Hypothesis-generating interviews for enteric infections should routinely include questions on contact with pets and other animals, pet food, 
pet treats, and pet supplements.
</P><P>Consumers and health departments should be aware that all dry pet food, pet treats 
(<I><a href="mm5525a3.htm">3</a></I>), and pet supplements (<I>4</I>) might 
be contaminated with pathogens such as 
<I>Salmonella</I>, and consumers should use precautions with all brands of dry pet 
food, treats, and supplements. In contrast, canned pet food is unlikely to be contaminated with such pathogens because 
the manufacturing process should eliminate bacterial contamination. To prevent 
<I>Salmonella</I> infections, persons should wash 
their hands for at least 20 seconds with warm water and soap immediately after handling dry pet foods, pet treats, and 
pet supplements, and especially before preparing and eating food for humans. Infants should be kept away from pet feeding 
areas. Children aged &lt;5 years should not be allowed to touch or eat dry pet food, treats, or supplements.
</P><P>In addition to transmission of 
<I>Salmonella</I> from contact with dry pet food, humans can acquire 
<I>Salmonella</I> infection from contact with the feces of animals that acquired 
<I>Salmonella</I> infection from contaminated dry pet food or other 
sources. Effective hand washing after handling pets and animal feces will prevent such infections. Persons who suspect that 
contact with dry pet food or pets has caused illness should consult their health-care providers. Additional information on 
the transmission of <I>Salmonella</I> from pets to humans is available at
