<p>Abstract
Condition: From 1991 through 1994, the number of legal induced
abortions reported to CDC declined each year by less than or equal
to 5% from the number reported for the preceding year.
Reporting Period Covered: This report summarizes and reviews
information reported to CDC regarding legal induced abortions
obtained in the United States during 1993 and 1994. This analysis
also includes recently reported abortion-related deaths that
occurred during 1991.
Description of System: For each year since 1969, CDC has compiled
abortion data received from 52 reporting areas: 50 states, the
District of Columbia, and New York City.
Results: In 1993, 1,330,414 legal abortions were reported to CDC,
representing a 2.1% decrease from the number reported for 1992; in
1994, 1,267,415 abortions were reported, representing a 4.7%
decrease from the number for 1993. In 1993 and 1994, the abortion
ratio was 334 and 321 legal induced abortions per 1,000 live
births, respectively. In 1993, the abortion rate was 22 per 1,000
women aged 15-44 years; in 1994, this rate declined to 21 per
1,000 women. Women who were undergoing an abortion were more
likely to be young, white, and unmarried; most were obtaining an
abortion for the first time. More than half of all abortions
 (52%-54%)
were performed at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation,
and approximately 88% were before 13 weeks. Approximately 15%-16%
of abortions were performed at less than or equal to 6 weeks of
gestation, 16% were performed at 7 weeks, and 22% at 8 weeks.
Younger women (i.e., women aged less than or equal to 19 years)
were more likely to obtain abortions later in pregnancy than were
older women. In 1991, 12 women died as a result of induced
abortion: 11 of these deaths were related to legal abortion and
one to illegal abortion. During 1991, the case-fatality rate of
legal induced abortion was 0.8 abortion-related deaths per 100,000
legal induced abortions.
Interpretation: Since 1990, the number of abortions has declined
each year. Since 1987, the abortion-to-live-birth ratio also has
declined; in 1994, it was the lowest recorded since 1977. This
decrease in the abortion ratio reflected the lower proportion of
pregnant women who obtained an induced abortion. As in previous
years, deaths related to legal induced abortions occurred rarely
(i.e., approximately one death per 100,000 legal induced
abortions).
Actions Taken: The number and characteristics of women who obtain
abortions in the United States should continue to be monitored so
that trends in induced abortion can be assessed, efforts to
prevent unintended pregnancy can be evaluated, and the preventable
causes of morbidity and mortality associated with abortions can be
identified and reduced. </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>In 1969, CDC began abortion surveillance to document the
number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced
abortions, monitor unintended pregnancy, and assist efforts to
identify and reduce preventable causes of morbidity and mortality
associated with abortions. This report is based primarily on
abortion data for 1993 and 1994 provided to CDC's National Center
for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of
Reproductive Health. </p>
<p>METHODS </p>
<p>For 1993 and 1994, CDC compiled data from 52 reporting areas:
50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City. The total
number of legal induced abortions was available from all reporting
areas; however, not all these areas collected information
regarding the characteristics of women who obtained abortions, and
the number of states reporting each characteristic differed.
States were excluded from the analysis if data regarding a given
characteristic were unknown for greater than 15% of women. </p>
<p>For 47 reporting areas, data concerning the number and
characteristics of legal induced abortions were provided from the
central health agency *; for the other five areas, data concerning
the number of abortions were provided from hospitals and other
medical facilities. Because information concerning the residence
of women who obtained abortions was not available from some
states, the procedures were reported by the state in which they
were performed. However, two reporting areas (the District of
Columbia and Wisconsin) reported abortions by state of residence;
occurrence data were unavailable for those areas. </p>
<p>For the analysis of age, women who obtained legal induced
abortions were grouped by 5-year age groups. Both ratios (i.e.,
the number of abortions per 1,000 live births per year) and rates
(the number of abortions per 1,000 women per year) are presented
by age group in this report. Ratios were calculated by using the
number of live births provided by each state's central health
agency (except where noted), and rates were calculated by using
the number of women reported in special unpublished tabulations
provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Because almost all
(94%) abortions among women less than 15 years of age are obtained
by those aged 13-14 years (1), the population of women aged 13-14
years was used as the denominator for calculating abortion rates
for women aged less than 15 years. Rates for women aged greater
than or equal to 40 years were based on the number of women aged
40-44 years, whereas rates for all women who obtained abortions
were based on the population of women aged 15-44 years. </p>
<p>Race was categorized by either three groups (i.e., a} white,
b} black, and c} all other races) or two groups (i.e., a} white
and b} black and all other races). &quot;Other&quot; races included
Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American/Alaskan Native, and women
classified as &quot;other&quot; race. </p>
<p>In 1990, data regarding Hispanic ethnicity were first
available on abortion reports submitted by central health agencies
to CDC. For the purposes of this surveillance system, Hispanic
ethnicity and race were evaluated separately. For the analysis of
abortions by race, women of Hispanic ethnicity were categorized as
white. </p>
<p>Marital status was reported as either married (which included
women who were married or separated) or unmarried (which usually
included those who were unmarried, divorced, or widowed).
Reporting of marital status differed somewhat by state,
particularly for the data used as denominators to calculate
abortion ratios by marital status; therefore, abortion ratios by
marital status should be interpreted cautiously. </p>
<p>Most areas that reported week of gestation at the time of
abortion also reported procedures obtained at less than or equal
to 8 weeks of gestation (38 of 41 in 1993 and 38 of 40 in 1994).
Gestational age (in weeks) at the time of abortion was reported by
most areas from estimates derived from the time elapsed since the
woman's last menstrual period. In 10 states in 1993 and 17 states
in 1994, gestational age was reported on the basis of the
physician's estimate, which could have included information from
the clinical examination as well as the time elapsed since the
last menstrual period. </p>
<p>CDC periodically has reported information concerning
abortion-related deaths; the first year for which such data were
available was 1972 (2). Sources for obtaining such information
included national and state vital records, maternal mortality
review committees, surveys, private citizens, the media,
health-care providers, and medical examiner reports. For each
reported case, clinical records and autopsy reports were requested
and reviewed by a medical epidemiologist to determine the cause of
death and verify that the death was abortion-related. </p>
<p>An abortion-related death was defined as a death resulting
from a) a direct complication of an abortion, b) an indirect
complication caused by the chain of events initiated by the
abortion, or c) aggravation of a preexisting condition by the
physiologic or psychologic effects of the abortion. Each
abortion-related death was then categorized as legal induced,
illegal induced, spontaneous, or unknown. Deaths that did not
satisfy the criteria of the case definition were classified as not
abortion-related. * Legal induced abortion was defined as a
procedure, performed by a licensed physician or someone acting
under the supervision of a licensed physician, that was intended
to terminate a suspected or known intrauterine pregnancy and to
produce a nonviable fetus at any gestational age (3,4). </p>
<p>Before 1978, no gestational age criteria were specified for
classifying spontaneous abortion-related deaths. For the reporting
year 1978, CDC defined spontaneous abortion as occurring before
the completion of the twentieth menstrual week (4). A detailed
review of all spontaneous abortion-related deaths during 1978-1989
resulted in the identification of seven deaths that had occurred
at greater than or equal to 20 weeks of gestation; these deaths
were reclassified as not abortion-related. </p>
<p>Included in this report are a) abortion-related deaths that
occurred during 1991 and b) updated totals for spontaneous
abortion-related deaths for 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1988, and 1989
(2,5). Case-fatality rates were calculated for legal induced
abortion-related deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions.
Trends in case-fatality rates for legal induced abortion for
 1972-1991
are reported. </p>
<p>RESULTS </p>
<p>For 1993, 1,330,414 legal induced abortions were reported to
CDC, representing a 2.1% decrease from the number reported for
1992 (5); for 1994, 1,267,415 abortions were reported,
representing a 4.7% decrease from the number for 1993
 (<a href="00049084.htm#00002628.htm">Table_1</a>).
In contrast, from 1970 through 1982, the reported number of legal
abortions in the United States had increased every year
 (<a href="00049084.htm#00002629.htm">Table_2</a>),
(<a href="00049084.htm#00001313.gif">Figure_1</a>); the largest percentage increase occurred from 1970
 to
1971. From 1976 through 1982, the annual increase declined
continuously and reached a low of 0.2% for both 1981 and 1982.
From 1983 through 1990, the number of abortions increased again,
although year-to-year fluctuations were less than or equal to 5%.
From 1991 through 1994, the annual number of abortions decreased
each year. </p>
<p>The legal induced abortion ratio increased from 1970 to 1980,
peaked at 364 abortions per 1,000 live births in 1984, and began
to decline steadily after 1987 (to 334 per 1,000 in 1993 and to
321 per 1,000 in 1994) (<a href="00049084.htm#00001313.gif">Figure_1</a>), (<a href="00049084.htm#00002629.htm">Table_2</a>). The legal
 induced
abortion rate increased from five abortions per 1,000 women aged
15-44 years in 1970 to 25 per 1,000 in 1980. From 1981 through
1992, the rate remained stable at 23-24 abortions per 1,000 women,
then declined to 22 in 1993 and to 21 in 1994. </p>
<p>In 1993 and 1994, as in previous years, most legal induced
abortions were performed in California, Florida, New York City,
and Texas; the fewest were performed in Idaho, North Dakota, South
Dakota, and Wyoming (<a href="00049084.htm#00002630.htm">Table_3</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002631.htm">Table_4</a>)) (2,6,7). For
women whose state of residence was known, approximately 91% had
 obtained
the abortion within the state in which they resided. In 1994, the
percentage of abortions obtained by out-of-state residents ranged
from approximately 52%-54% in the District of Columbia to less
than 1% in Hawaii. For both 1993 and 1994, nine reporting areas
did not provide data concerning abortions obtained by out-of-state
residents. </p>
<p>Women aged 20-24 years obtained approximately one third (34%
in 1993 and 33% in 1994) of all abortions; women aged less than 15
years obtained less than 1% of all abortions (<a href="00049084.htm#00002632.htm">Table_5</a>) and
(<a href="00049084.htm#00002633.htm">Table_6</a>). Abortion ratios were highest for women in the
 youngest
(i.e., less than 15 years and 15-19 years) and the oldest (greater
 than or
equal to 40 years) age groups (<a href="00049084.htm#00001314.gif">Figure_2</a>). The abortion ratio
 for
women aged less than 15 years was 744 abortions per 1,000 live
births in 1993 and 704 per 1,000 in 1994. The ratio for women aged
15-19 years (440 and 415 abortions per 1,000 live births in 1993
and 1994, respectively) was similar to that for women aged greater
than or equal to 40 years (430 and 412 abortions per 1,000 live
births in 1993 and 1994, respectively). The ratio was lowest for
women aged 30-34 years (180 and 172 abortions per 1,000 live
births in 1993 and 1994, respectively). Among adolescents, the
abortion ratio was highest for those aged less than 15 years and
lowest for those aged 19 years (<a href="00049084.htm#00002634.htm">Table_7</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002635.htm">Table_8</a>).
Abortion rates were highest for women aged 20-24 years (42
abortions per 1,000 women in 1993 and 39 per 1,000 in 1994) and
lowest for women at the reproductive-age extremes (i.e., for women
aged less than 15 years, three abortions per 1,000 women in 1993
and two per 1,000 in 1994; for women aged greater than or equal to
40 years, two abortions per 1,000 women in 1993 and 1994)
 (<a href="00049084.htm#00002632.htm">Table_5</a>)
and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002633.htm">Table_6</a>). </p>
<p>For women in most age groups, the abortion ratio increased
from 1974 through the early to mid-1980s and declined thereafter,
particularly for the youngest and oldest reproductive-aged women
(<a href="00049084.htm#00001315.gif">Figure_3</a>). The abortion ratios for women aged less than 15
 years
have been higher than for the other age groups. In 1994, the
abortion ratio decreased for women aged 15-19 years and was the
lowest ever recorded for that age group. The abortion ratio for
women aged 20-34 years (i.e., the group with the highest fertility
rate) has remained stable since the mid-1980s (8). </p>
<p>During 1993 and 1994, approximately 51%-53% of reported legal
induced abortions were obtained at less than or equal to 8 weeks
of gestation, and about 86% were obtained at less than 13 weeks
(<a href="00049084.htm#00002636.htm">Table_9</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002637.htm">Table_10</a>). In 1993 and 1994, approximately
14%-15% of abortions were performed at less than or equal to 6
 weeks of
gestation, approximately 16% at 7 weeks, and approximately 21% at
8 weeks (<a href="00049084.htm#00002638.htm">Table_11</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002639.htm">Table_12</a>). Few abortions were
 provided
after 15 weeks of gestation -- approximately 4% of abortions were
 obtained
at 16-20 weeks, and 1.2%-1.3% were obtained at greater than or
 equal
to 21 weeks (<a href="00049084.htm#00001316.gif">Figure_4</a>). </p>
<p>During both 1993 and 1994, approximately 98% of legal induced
abortions were performed by curettage, and less than 1% by
intrauterine saline or prostaglandin instillation (<a href="00049084.htm#00002640.htm">Table_13</a>
 and
<a href="00049084.htm#00002641.htm">Table_14</a>). Hysterectomy and hysterotomy seldom were used; less
 than
0.01% of abortions were performed by using these methods. </p>
<p>As in previous years, approximately 60% of women who obtained
legal induced abortions were white (<a href="00049084.htm#00002642.htm">Table_15</a>) and
 (<a href="00049084.htm#00002643.htm">Table_16</a>)
(2,6). Abortion ratios for black women were 552 abortions per 1,000
 live
births in 1993 and 538 per 1,000 in 1994; these ratios were almost
2.5 times the ratios for white women (231 abortions per 1,000 live
births in 1993 and 217 per 1,000 in 1994). Abortion ratios for
women of other races (310 abortions per 1,000 live births in 1993
and 325 per 1,000 in 1994) were approximately 1.3-1.5 times the
ratios for white women. In addition, abortion rates for black
women (43 and 40 abortions per 1,000 black women in 1993 and 1994,
respectively) were approximately three times the rates for white
women (15 and 13 abortions per 1,000 white women in 1993 and 1994,
respectively). </p>
<p>Twenty-one states in 1993 and 22 states in 1994, the District
of Columbia, and New York City * reported information concerning
the Hispanic ethnicity of women who obtained legal induced
abortions (<a href="00049084.htm#00002644.htm">Table_17</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002645.htm">Table_18</a>). The percentage of
 abortions
obtained by Hispanic women in these reporting areas ranged from
 less than
1% in several states to approximately 39%-40% in New Mexico. For
Hispanic women in these reporting areas, the abortion ratio was
289 abortions per 1,000 live births in 1993 and 278 per 1,000 in
1994 -- slightly lower than the ratio for non-Hispanics in the same

areas (309 and 290 abortions per 1,000 live births in 1993 and
1994, respectively). However, the abortion rate per 1,000 Hispanic
women (30 abortions per 1,000 women in 1993 and 29 per 1,000 in
1994) was greater than the rate per 1,000 non-Hispanic women (20
per 1,000 women in 1993 and 18 per 1,000 in 1994). </p>
<p>Seventy-seven to 78 percent of women who obtained abortions
were unmarried (<a href="00049084.htm#00002646.htm">Table_19</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002647.htm">Table_20</a>)). Abortion ratios
 for
unmarried women were approximately nine times the ratios for
 married women
(789 vs. 84 abortions per 1,000 live births in 1993, and 689 vs.
79 in 1994). </p>
<p>Approximately 45%-46% of women who obtained legal induced
abortions had had no previous live births, and about 88%-89% had
had two or fewer previous live births (<a href="00049084.htm#00002648.htm">Table_21</a>)  and
 (<a href="00049084.htm#00002649.htm">Table_22</a>).
The abortion ratio in 1994 was highest for women who had had no
previous live births and women who had had two previous live
births. The ratio was lowest for women who had had one previous
live birth. </p>
<p>In 1993 and 1994, approximately 54% of women who obtained a
legal abortion were doing so for the first time. Approximately
17%-18% of women who obtained a legal abortion had had at least
two previous legal abortions (<a href="00049084.htm#00002650.htm">Table_23</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002651.htm">Table_24</a>). </p>
<p>The age distribution of women who obtained a legal abortion
differed only slightly by race (<a href="00049084.htm#00002652.htm">Table_25</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002653.htm">Table_26</a>).
However, for women of black or other races, the percentage who were

less than 15 years of age, although small (1.2%), was twice the
percentage for white women (0.6%). The percentage of women of black

or other races who were unmarried (82% in 1993 and 83% in 1994)
 also was
slightly higher than the percentage of white women (77% in 1993
and 78% in 1994). Few differences were found by age and Hispanic
ethnicity (<a href="00049084.htm#00002654.htm">Table_27</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002655.htm">Table_28</a>). Of those women who
 obtained
an abortion, a slightly higher percentage of non-Hispanic women
 were
unmarried in comparison with Hispanic women. </p>
<p>Most women (88%) obtained an abortion during the first 12
weeks of pregnancy; however, adolescents (i.e., women aged less
than or equal to 19 years) were more likely than older women to
obtain abortions later in pregnancy (<a href="00049084.htm#00002656.htm">Table_29</a>) and
 (<a href="00049084.htm#00002657.htm">Table_30</a>).
The percentage of women who obtained an abortion early in pregnancy

(i.e., at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation) increased
with age. The percentage who obtained an abortion late in
pregnancy (at greater than or equal to 16 weeks of gestation)
decreased with age for women up to 25-29 years of age, and then
remained stable for women in older age groups (<a href="00049084.htm#00001317.gif">Figure_5</a>). Black

women were more likely to obtain an abortion later in pregnancy
than were white women or women of other races (<a href="00049084.htm#00002656.htm">Table_29</a>) and
(<a href="00049084.htm#00002657.htm">Table_30</a>). Although Hispanic women were slightly more likely
 than
non-Hispanic women to have had an abortion at less than or equal
to 8 weeks of gestation, the overall differences between Hispanic
and non-Hispanic women in the timing of abortions were minimal
(<a href="00049084.htm#00002656.htm">Table_29</a>) (<a href="00049084.htm#00002657.htm">Table_30</a>) (<a href="00049084.htm#00002658.htm">Table_31</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002659.htm">Table_32</a>). </p>
<p>More than 99% of abortions at less than or equal to 12 weeks
of gestation were performed by using curettage (primarily suction
procedures) (<a href="00049084.htm#00002660.htm">Table_33</a>) and (<a href="00049084.htm#00002661.htm">Table_34</a>). After 12 weeks of
gestation, the most frequently used procedure also was curettage,
although it usually was reported as dilatation and evacuation
 (D&amp;E).
About the same proportion of intrauterine instillations involved
 the use
of saline or prostaglandin; these procedures were used primarily at

greater than or equal to 16 weeks of gestation. </p>
<p>CDC received reports of 32 possible abortion-related deaths
for 1991 (i.e., the most recent year for which such data were
available). A review of these cases indicated that 18 of the 32
women died from abortion-related causes (<a href="00049084.htm#00002662.htm">Table_35</a>). Eleven of
 the
deaths were associated with legal induced abortion; one death,
illegal induced abortion; and six deaths, spontaneous abortion.
Possible abortion-related deaths that occurred during 1992-1994
are being investigated. </p>
<p>All deaths reported to CDC for 1972-1990 that had been
classified as &quot;spontaneous abortion-related&quot; were reviewed. Seven
of these deaths had occurred during 1979-1989 among women at
greater than or equal to 20 weeks of gestation. Because these
deaths did not meet the criteria for spontaneous abortion-related
deaths, they were reclassified as not abortion-related (i.e.,
pregnancy-related). </p>
<p>The case-fatality rate for legal induced abortion in 1991 was
0.8 deaths per 100,000 legal abortions. During 1980-1991, annual
case-fatality rates for legal induced abortion-related deaths were
less than or equal to 1.2 deaths per 100,000 legal induced
abortions (<a href="00049084.htm#00002662.htm">Table_35</a>) , (<a href="00049084.htm#00001318.gif">Figure_6</a>). </p>
<p>DISCUSSION </p>
<p>In the United States, the annual number of abortions has
decreased each year since 1990 (i.e., the year in which the number
of abortions was highest) (<a href="00049084.htm#00002629.htm">Table_2</a>)) (2,6,7). In 1994, the
 national
abortion-to-live-birth ratio was the lowest recorded since 1976.
The abortion ratio had increased steadily from 1970 through 1980,
decreased slightly during 1981-1983, increased to its highest
level in 1984, then remained fairly stable until 1987, before
beginning to decline (<a href="00049084.htm#00002629.htm">Table_2</a> , (<a href="00049084.htm#00001313.gif">Figure_1</a>). This decline in
 the
abortion-to-live-birth ratio probably resulted from several
complex factors, such as reduced access to abortion services,
changes in contraceptive practices, attitudinal changes concerning
abortion and/or carrying unplanned pregnancies to term, and the
decreased number of unintended pregnancies (9-12). </p>
<p>Induced abortion rates in the United States for 1993-1994
were a) higher than rates reported previously by Australia and
Western European countries and b) lower than rates reported by
China, Cuba, Eastern European countries, and the New Independent
States of the former Soviet Union (13). In addition, for 1994, the
legal induced abortion rate in Canada was exactly half the rate in
the United States (10.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years
vs. 21 per 1,000, respectively), and the abortion-to-live-birth
ratio in Canada also was approximately half the ratio in the
United States (186 abortions per 1,000 live births vs. 321 per
1,000, respectively) (14). Both abortion rates and birth rates
among teenagers have been higher in the United States than in most
Western European countries and some Eastern European countries
(15). </p>
<p>As in previous years, the abortion ratio in 1993 and 1994
differed substantially by age (2,6). Although the abortion ratio
was highest for adolescents, the percentage of legal induced
abortions obtained by women aged less than or equal to 19 years
decreased steadily from the mid-1980s through 1994 (i.e., from 26%
in 1984 to 22% in 1990 and to 20% in 1994) (7,16). Since 1980, the
abortion ratio has declined for most age groups -- particularly for

women aged less than or equal to 19 years and greater than or
equal to 35 years. In 1994, the abortion ratio for women aged 15-19

years was the lowest ratio CDC had ever recorded for that age
group. Other studies indicated a decrease in pregnancies among
women aged 15-19 years during 1991-1992 (17). Factors such as an
overall decrease in the number of abortions, changing access to
abortion services (10), and ongoing changes in abortion laws
(e.g., parental consent or notification laws and mandatory waiting
periods) -- all of which are likely to disproportionately affect
adolescents -- could have affected this decline in the abortion
ratio (18,19). </p>
<p>In 1993 and 1994, the abortion ratio for black women was more
than twice the ratio for white women, and this differential has
increased since 1986. In addition, the abortion rate for black
women was approximately three times the rate for white women.
Race-specific differences in legal induced abortion ratios and
rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic
status, contraceptive use, incidence of unintended pregnancies,
and access to family planning and contraceptive services. </p>
<p>The abortion-to-live-birth ratio for Hispanic women during
1993 and 1994 was slightly lower than that for non-Hispanic women.
Other published reports indicate that pregnant Hispanic women are
less likely than pregnant non-Hispanic women to obtain an abortion
(20). However, the abortion rate per 1,000 Hispanic women was
higher than the rate for non-Hispanic women, a finding that is
consistent with several previously published reports (20,21). For
women in all age groups, fertility was higher for Hispanic than
for non-Hispanic women (8). </p>
<p>For 1994, a total of 34 states, the District of Columbia, and
New York City reported Hispanic ethnicity of women who obtained
abortions. Because of concerns regarding the completeness of such
information in some states, data from only 22 states, the District
of Columbia, and New York City were evaluated to determine the
number and percentage of abortions obtained by women of Hispanic
ethnicity. These geographical areas represented approximately 44%
of all reproductive-aged Hispanic women in the United States
during 1994 (CDC, unpublished data). One published report of a
study that used abortion data obtained from CDC also suggests that
the number of Hispanic women who obtain abortions may be
underestimated (21). Thus, the number, ratio, and rate of
abortions for Hispanic women in this surveillance summary might
not be representative of the overall Hispanic population in the
United States (i.e., these data might reflect utilization of
abortion services only in the states used for this analysis). </p>
<p>The percentage distribution of abortions by gestational age
was stable from 1980 through 1994, with slight increases toward
the earliest and latest gestational ages (<a href="00049084.htm#00002628.htm">Table_1</a>). Since 1992,

most reporting areas have reported gestational age, in weeks of
gestation, for abortions performed at less than or equal to 8
weeks (2). These data will assist in monitoring trends in legal
abortions as new medical and surgical methods of terminating
pregnancy are implemented, because these new methods are primarily
for termination of pregnancies at less than or equal to 8 weeks of
gestation (22-25). </p>
<p>In this and previous reports, age was inversely associated
with timing of abortion (2,26,27). Younger women were more likely
to obtain an abortion later in gestation than were older women. </p>
<p>From 1972 to 1994, the percentage of abortions performed by
curettage (which includes D&amp;E) increased from 89% to 99%
 ((Table_1|)),
and the percentage of abortions performed by intrauterine
instillation and by hysterectomy and hysterotomy declined sharply
(from 10% to 0.5% and from 0.6% to less than 0.01%, respectively).
From 1974 through 1994, the percentage of second-trimester
abortions performed by D&amp;E increased from 31% to 94%; the
percentage of second-trimester abortions performed by intrauterine
instillation decreased from 57% to 4% (28). The increasing
reliance on D&amp;E probably has resulted from the lower risk for
complications associated with the procedure (29,30). </p>
<p>Since CDC's surveillance of abortion mortality began in 1972,
the annual number of deaths associated with legal induced abortion
has decreased by 54% (as of 1991) (31). In 1972, 63 women died as
a result of induced abortion. Of those deaths, 24 were associated
with legal abortion and 39 with illegal abortion. In 1991, 12
women died as a result of induced abortion: 11 of these deaths
were associated with legal abortion and one with illegal abortion.
The case-fatality rate decreased approximately 80% between 1972
(4.1 deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions) and 1991 (0.8
deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions). These rates,
consistent with previously published data for the 1970s and
mid-1980s (32-34) indicated that the risk for death from legal
induced abortion continues to be extremely low. </p>
<p>The numbers, ratios, and rates of abortion from this analysis
are conservative estimates because the numbers of legal abortions
reported to CDC for 1993 and 1994 were probably lower than the
numbers actually performed. Totals provided by central health
agencies are often lower than those obtained by direct surveys of
abortion providers (2). For example, the total number of abortions
reported to CDC for 1992 * was approximately 11% lower than that
reported by The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI), a private
organization that directly contacts abortion providers to obtain
information concerning the number of abortions performed (11).
However, since 1987, there has been a decrease in the percentage
difference in the number of abortions reported to AGI compared
with the number reported to CDC. In addition, not all states
collected and/or reported information (e.g., age, race, and
gestational age) concerning women who obtained a legal induced
abortion during 1993 and 1994; therefore, the numbers,
percentages, rates, and ratios derived from this analysis may not
be representative of all women who obtained abortions in those
years. </p>
<p>Despite these limitations, findings from ongoing national
surveillance of legal induced abortion are used for several
purposes. First, data from abortion surveillance are used to
identify characteristics of women at high risk for unintended
pregnancy. Second, ongoing annual surveillance is essential to
monitor trends in the number, ratio, and rate of abortions in the
United States. Third, statistics on the number of pregnancies
ending in abortion are used in conjunction with birth statistics
to estimate pregnancy rates (e.g., pregnancy rates among
teenagers) (1) and other outcome rates (e.g., the rate of ectopic
pregnancies per 1,000 pregnancies). Fourth, abortion and pregnancy
rates can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of family planning
programs and programs for preventing unintended pregnancy. Fifth,
ongoing surveillance provides data for assessing changes in
clinical practice patterns related to abortion (e.g., longitudinal
changes in the types of procedures and trends in gestational age
at the time of abortion). Finally, these data are used as the
denominator in calculating abortion morbidity and mortality rates. </p>
<p>Induced abortions are linked usually to unintended
pregnancies, which often occur despite use of contraception
(19,35,36). In 1995, approximately 31% of live births to women
aged 15-44 years were associated with unintended pregnancy (i.e.,
either mistimed or unwanted at conception) (12). In one study
during 1994 and 1995, 58% of women who underwent an abortion
reported that they &quot;currently used&quot; contraception during the month
of their last menstrual period; however, the use of contraception
might have been inconsistent or incorrect (21). Therefore,
education regarding improved contraceptive practices, as well as
access to and education regarding safe, effective, and low-cost
contraception and family planning services, can help reduce the
incidence of unintended pregnancy and, therefore, reduce the use
of legal induced abortion in the United States (37). </p>
<p>Recently passed welfare-reform legislation -- the Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 * </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    may increase the interest in accurate state-based surveillance
 of
    induced abortion. In addition, some states have recently
    instituted programs that emphasize the prevention of unintended
    pregnancy, particularly among adolescents. To help guide these
    efforts, an ongoing, accurate assessment of induced abortion is
    needed in all states to determine the number and characteristics
    of women who obtain these procedures. </p>
    </li>

<p>Additional statistical and epidemiologic information about
legal induced abortions is available from CDC's automated
Reproductive Health Information System. This system provides
information by fax, voice recordings, or mail; telephone (404)

* In 1978, CDC defined "spontaneous abortion-related deaths" as those deaths that occurred at <20 completed
  weeks of estimated gestational age. Deaths that occurred at estimated gesta-tional ages 320 weeks were
  classified as stillbirths. Before 1978, criteria for gestational age were unspecified.
+ Legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions.
