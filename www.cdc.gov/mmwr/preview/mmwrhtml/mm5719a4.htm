<H1>Multistate Outbreak of Human <I>Salmonella</I> Infections Caused 
by Contaminated Dry Dog Food --- United States, 2006--2007</FONT></H1>
</P><P>During January 1, 2006--December 31, 2007, CDC collaborated with public health officials in Pennsylvania, 
other states, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a prolonged multistate outbreak 
of <I>Salmonella enterica</I> serotype Schwarzengrund infections in 
humans. A total of 70 cases of <I>S.</I> Schwarzengrund 
infection with the outbreak strain (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] pattern JM6X01.0015) were identified in 
19 states, mostly in the northeastern United States. This report describes the outbreak investigation, which identified 
the source of infection as dry dog food produced at a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania. This investigation is the first 
to identify contaminated dry dog food as a source of human 
<I>Salmonella</I> infections. After handling pet foods, pet 
owners should wash their hands immediately, and infants 
should be kept away from pet feeding areas.
</P><P>On May 8, 2007, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Laboratories reported three cases of 
<I>S.</I> Schwarzengrund infection with indistinguishable PFGE patterns to CDC's 
PulseNet.* On June 9, 2007, after PulseNet identified cases in Ohio 
and other states, CDC's 
OutbreakNet<SUP>&#134;</SUP> team was notified of a potential multistate outbreak of 
<I>S.</I> Schwarzengrund infections. During June 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) interviewed persons identified by PulseNet 
as infected with the outbreak strain of <I>S</I>. 
Schwarzengrund. These initial interviews suggested 
exposure to dogs or dry dog food as a possible source of infection. Thirteen infected persons from Pennsylvania were questioned about 
dog-related exposures: eight (62%) owned one or more dogs, and the other 
five<I> </I>reported regular contact with a dog. Seven of 
the eight persons who owned dogs were able to recall the types of dog food they had purchased recently. Several brands 
had been purchased, but persons in the households of six patients recalled purchasing dog food products made 
by manufacturer A. These interviews suggested exposure to dogs or dry dog foods as a possible source of infection. 
</P><P>PADOH collected dog stool specimens and opened bags of dry dog food from the homes of the 13 
Pennsylvania patients. The outbreak strain of 
<I>S.</I> Schwarzengrund was isolated from five of 13 dog stool specimens and two of 22 
dry dog food specimens collected from the homes. The contaminated dry dog food bags were two different brands (brand 
A and brand B), both produced by manufacturer A at plant A in Pennsylvania. 
</P><P>In July 2007, the Ohio Department of Health also 
interviewed persons infected with the outbreak strain 
of <I>S</I>. Schwarzengrund and collected two dog stool specimens from one patient's home. The outbreak strain of 
<I>S</I>. Schwarzengrund was isolated from one of the dog stool specimens. The dog 
recently had been fed brand A dry dog food, but the bag of 
dog food was no longer available for testing. 
<H4>
<B>Epidemiologic Investigation</B>
</H4>
</P><P>A case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed infection with the outbreak strain of 
<I>S.</I> Schwarzengrund in a person residing in the United States who either had symptoms beginning on or after January 1, 2006, or (if the symptom 
onset date was unknown) had <I>S. </I>Schwarzengrund isolated from a specimen on or after January 1, 2006. During 
January 1, 2006--December 31, 2007, a total of 70 human 
cases of the outbreak strain of <I>S. </I>Schwarzengrund were 
reported to CDC via PulseNet from 19 states (<a href="mm5719a4.htm#fig1">Figures 
1</a> and <a href="mm5719a4.htm#fig2">2</a>). The last reported illness onset date was October 1, 2007. No 
illness was reported in pets.
</P><P>The largest number of reported cases was in Pennsylvania (29 cases), followed by New York (nine) and Ohio 
(seven) (<a href = "mm5719a4.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Among 61 ill persons whose age was available, the median age was 3 years (range: 1 
month--85 years), and 24 (39%) were aged 
<U>&lt;</U>1 year; of 45 persons whose sex was known, 22 (49%) were female. Of 38 ill persons for 
whom clinical information was available, 15 (39%) had bloody diarrhea; of 45 persons whose hospitalization status was 
known, 11 (24%) had been hospitalized. No deaths were reported. 
<H4>
<B>Case-Control Study</B>
</H4>
</P><P>To determine the source of infections caused by the outbreak strain of 
<I>S.</I> Schwarzengrund, the OutbreakNet team coordinated a multistate case-control study during July 17--September 28, 2007. Case-patient households were 
defined as those with at least one member infected with the outbreak strain of 
<I>S.</I> Schwarzengrund with an illness onset date 
or isolation date occurring during January 1, 2006--August 30, 2007. For each case-patient household, one to 
three geographically matched control households were 
recruited using a reverse--digit-dialing system. Persons in each 
case-patient and control household were asked whether they had been exposed to dry dog or dry cat food, which brands 
they usually purchased, and which brands they purchased in the 2 weeks before illness onset (for cases) or the 2 weeks 
before interview (for controls). Data were analyzed as a matched case-control study, and a multivariable logistic analysis 
was conducted to control for confounding from coexposures.
</P><P>One person was interviewed in each of 43 case-patient households and 144 control households in eight 
states: Delaware, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Case-patient and 
control households were excluded from analysis where questions were not answered. Contact with a dog was reported by 
34 (79%) persons in case-patient households compared with 86 (60%) persons in control households (matched odds 
ratio [mOR] = 2.7) (<a href = "mm5719a4.htm#tab">Table</a>). Dry dog or cat food produced by manufacturer A usually was chosen for purchase by members 
of 19 (44%) case-patient households compared with 14 (10%) of control households (mOR = 7.8; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 2.6--27.8). 
</P><P>Among the 19 persons in case-patient households who usually purchased manufacturer A pet food, 11 
purchased brand A, three brand B, five brand C, and three brand D. All four brands were produced at plant A. Among the 
four brands, brand A typically was purchased by 11 (26%) persons in case-patient households compared with six 
(4%) persons in control households. In multivariable analysis, purchase of brand A was associated with illness (mOR = 
23.7) (<a href = "mm5719a4.htm#tab">Table</a>). In Pennsylvania alone, purchase of brand A also was associated with human illness  in multivariable 
analysis (mOR = 15.4; CI = 2.1--infinity).
<H4>
<B>Environmental Investigation</B>
</H4>
</P><P>During 2007, plant A produced approximately 25 brands of dry pet food; specific distribution information for 
brands produced in plant A was not available. Plant A labeled these dry pet foods with a 1-year shelf life (i.e., sell-by date). 
On July 12, 2007, PADOH staff members visited plant A and collected 144 swabs of specimens from 
environmental surfaces; the outbreak strain of 
<I>S</I>. Schwarzengrund was isolated from one sample. FDA tested previously unopened 
bags of seven brands (brands E, F, G, H, I, J, and K) of dry dog food produced at plant A. Two brands of dry dog food (E 
and F) yielded the outbreak strain of <I>S. </I>Schwarzengrund. On August 21, 2007, manufacturer A announced a 
voluntary recall of 50-pound bags of brand E dry dog food and 5-pound bags of brand F dry dog food. On July 26, 
2007, manufacturer A suspended operations at plant A for cleaning and disinfection. In mid-November 2007, plant 
A resumed normal operations.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> The laboratory and epidemiologic evidence in this investigation indicates that dry dog food 
produced by manufacturer A at plant A in Pennsylvania and sold under several brand names caused human illness during 
2006--2007. Although previous reports in North America have associated 
<I>Salmonella</I> infection with certain pet treats, 
this report is the first to associate 
<I>Salmonella</I> with contaminated dry dog food. The 
case-control study found an association between infections in households and use of dry dog food or dry cat food produced by manufacturer A. In addition, 
the outbreak strain was isolated from 1) opened bags of dry dog food (brands A and B) that were produced in plant A 
by manufacturer A, 2) stool specimens from dogs in case-patient households that ate dry dog food produced in plant A, 
3) an environmental sample from plant A, and 4) two bags (brands E and F) of previously unopened dry dog 
food produced in plant A.
</P><P>A voluntary recall of specific-sized bags of two brands of dry dog food issued by the manufacturer in August 2007 
was based only on lot-specific testing of finished unopened bags found to be positive for 
<I>Salmonella</I> by official FDA testing. Other sizes of bags of the two brands of dry dog food, although produced at plant A, were not recalled. Other brands of 
dry dog or cat food produced at plant A, including brands associated epidemiologically and microbiologically with illness, 
also were not included in the recall.
</P><P>Plant A ceased operations during July--November 2007 to allow for cleaning and disinfection. However, because 
dry pet food has a 1-year shelf life and all contaminated products were not recalled, contaminated dry pet food might still 
be found in homes and could provide the potential for causing illness. Only an estimated 3% of 
<I>Salmonella </I>infections are laboratory-confirmed and reported to surveillance systems 
(<I>2</I>); therefore, this outbreak likely was larger than the 
70 laboratory-confirmed cases identified. 
</P><P>Most <I>Salmonella</I> infections are acquired by handling or consuming contaminated food products, particularly foods 
of animal origin. Infections also are acquired by direct and indirect contact with farm animals, reptiles, and 
occasionally pets. Investigations are ongoing to determine how persons might acquire 
<I>Salmonella</I> infections from dry pet food. 
Factors under review include the handling and storage of dry pet food, hand-washing practices, exposure of children to dry 
pet food, and location in the home where pets are fed. Although a specific source of contamination for the pet food 
from plant A was not identified, the plant equipment might have been contaminated, or contaminated 
ingredients might have been delivered to plant A. Dry pet foods typically are extruded, and production includes heat treatment, but 
the extruded food also is spray-coated with a taste enhancer, usually an animal fat. 
</P><P>Outbreaks of human illness associated with 
animal-derived pet treats have been described previously in North 
America (<I>3--<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5525a3.htm">6</a></I>). These include outbreaks of 
<I>Salmonella</I> Infantis infection caused by contaminated pig ear pet treats 
(<I>3,4</I>), <I>Salmonella</I> Newport infection caused by contaminated pet treats containing dried beef 
(<I>5</I>), and <I>Salmonella</I> Thompson infections associated with contact with contaminated pet treats made from of beef or seafood 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5525a3.htm">6</a></I>). Follow-up investigations of these outbreaks demonstrated that pet treats were frequently contaminated with 
<I>Salmonella</I> organisms. After a 1999 outbreak in Canada, 
<I>Salmonella</I> organisms were isolated from 48 (51%) of 94 samples of pig ear pet 
treats purchased from local retail stores 
(<I>5</I>). During 1999--2000 in the United States, 
<I>Salmonella </I>strains were isolated from 65 (41%) of 158 samples of pig ear and other animal-derived pet treats purchased from retail stores 
(<I>7</I>). 
</P><P>FDA regulates pet foods, treats, and supplements. If 
<I>Salmonella </I>is present, these products are considered 
adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FDC) 
Act.<SUP>&#167;</SUP> During January 1--July 27, 2007, at least 15 pet 
food products were recalled because of 
<I>Salmonella</I> contamination (<I>8</I>). On November 2, 2007, a single brand of pet 
vitamin was recalled voluntarily by the manufacturer because of possible 
<I>Salmonella</I> contamination (<I>9</I>). 
<I>Salmonella </I>contamination has not been identified in canned pet food, probably because the manufacturing process 
eliminates contamination. However, 
<I>Salmonella</I> contamination has been associated with raw pet food diets 
(<I>10</I>). 
</P><P>Persons who suspect that contact with dry dog food has caused illness should consult their health-care providers. 
Most persons infected with <I>Salmonella</I> develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12--72 hours after infection, 
and <I>Salmonella</I> infection usually is diagnosed by culture of a stool sample. Illness typically lasts 4--7 days, and most 
persons recover without treatment. Infants, elderly persons, and persons with impaired immune systems are more likely 
than others to develop severe illness. To prevent 
<I>Salmonella</I> infections, persons should wash their hands for at least 20 
seconds with warm water and soap immediately after handling dry pet foods, pet treats, and pet supplements, and 
before preparing food and eating. Infants should be kept away from pet feeding areas. Children aged &lt;5 years should not 
be allowed to touch or eat pet food, treats, or 
supplements.<SUP>&#182;</SUP>
