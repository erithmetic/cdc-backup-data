<p>Summary </p>
<p>This report provides interim biosafety guidelines for
 preventing
laboratory-associated infections with agents that cause hantavirus
 pulmonary
syndrome. The guidelines are based on extensive laboratory
 experience with
the other hantaviruses -- particularly work involving the use of
 permissive
host animal species -- and on the limited experience with a
 hantavirus
recently isolated from deer mice. The guidelines address handling
 patient-
derived specimens, propagating viruses in culture (including viral
 concen-
trate preparations), and housing and handling infected animals.
 These
recommendations were developed with the assistance of expert
 consultants
during a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and
 Hygiene,
Subcommittee on Arbovirus Laboratory Safety, November 2, 1993, in
 Atlanta. </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>One or more newly identified hantaviruses have been implicated
 as the
cause of a new disease, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) (1-3).
 HPS is
characterized by a febrile prodrome, followed by the rapid onset of
 noncar-
diogenic pulmonary edema and hypotension or shock. More than half
 the
identified patients have died. As of April 5, 1994, 68 cases had
 been
reported from 17 states (4,5; CDC, unpublished data, 1994). Most of
 these
cases have been associated with a single virus isolated from deer
 mice
obtained in New Mexico (6); the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus)
 is its
principal reservoir (7). Three other new hantaviruses have been
 identified in
the Americas. Two were inferred from genetic sequences detected by
 reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in lung tissue
 from HPS
patients. A third hantavirus was isolated from the cotton rat
 (Sigmodon
hispidus) after antibodies and RT-PCR had identified a target
 rodent species.
CDC recently published recommendations to assist residents of the
 endemic
area in avoiding exposure to rodents (8). </p>
<p>Hantaviruses are a genus in the family Bunyaviridae, which are
 lipid-
enveloped viruses with a negative-stranded RNA genome composed of
 three
unique segments. Like other lipid-enveloped viruses, they are
 susceptible to
most disinfectants (e.g., dilute hypochlorite solutions, phenolics,

detergents, 70% alcohol, or most general-purpose household
 disinfectants)
(9). The survival time of these viruses in the environment in
 liquids or
aerosols or in a dried state is not known. Limited studies with
 Hantaan virus
have shown sensitivity to a pH of less than or equal to 5. However,

infectivity has been reported to persist in neutral solutions for
 several
hours at 37 C (98.6 F) and for several days at lower temperatures,
 as well as
in dried cell-culture medium for up to 2 days (10; Huggins,
 unpublished data,
1994). </p>
<p>Human hantavirus infection has been associated most often with
 hemor-
rhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Several pathogenic viruses
 that have
been recognized within the genus include Hantaan virus, which
 causes the most
severe form of HFRS and is present primarily in Asia; Dobrava
 virus, which
causes serious HFRS and has been identified in the Balkans; Puumala
 virus,
which causes a milder form of HFRS and a higher proportion of
 subclinical
infections and is prevalent in Europe; and Seoul virus, which
 results in a
less severe form of HFRS when humans are infected and has a
 worldwide distri-
bution. Serious or fatal disease may follow infection with any of
 these
viruses. The clinical consequences of infection with Prospect Hill
 virus,
which has been identified in the United States, are unknown, but
 antibodies
have been detected in humans who could not recall an illness
 typical of HFRS
(11). </p>
<p>Each member of the genus is associated with a specific rodent
 host (e.g.,
the striped field mouse {Apodemus agrarius} for Hantaan virus; the
 urban
sewer rat {Rattus norvegicus} for Seoul virus; and the meadow vole
 {Microtus
pennsylvanicus} for Prospect Hill virus). Hantaviruses do not cause
 apparent
illness in their reservoir hosts, which remain asymptomatically
 infected for
life (12). Infected rodents shed virus in saliva, urine, and feces
 for many
weeks, but the duration of shedding and the period of maximum
 infectivity are
unknown (13). The demonstrated presence of infectious virus in the
 saliva of
infected rodents, the sensitivity of these animals to parenteral
 inoculation
with hantaviruses, and field observations of infected rodents
 indicate that
biting is an important mode of rodent-to-rodent transmission
 (7,14). </p>
<p>Hantaviruses may be present in the blood, organs, saliva,
 feces, or urine
of infected animals. In studies in the southwestern United States
 in 1993
(7), about one-third of trapped deer mice (P. maniculatus) had
 hantavirus
antibodies. Viral RNA with hantavirus sequences was demonstrated by
 RT-PCR in
the tissues of virtually all antibody-positive and some
 antibody-negative
deer mice. Antibody prevalences and the proportions of animals
 tested that
had viral RNA demonstrable by RT-PCR were lower in other species of
 rodents
(1,7). </p>
<p>HUMAN INFECTIONS </p>
<p>Aerosols from infective saliva or excreta of rodents have been
 clearly
implicated in the transmission of hantaviruses to humans. Persons
 visiting
animal holding areas in laboratories where infected rodents were
 housed have
been infected after approximately 5 minutes of exposure (15-17).
 The relative
importance of primary aerosols from freshly shed material compared
 with
secondary aerosols from dried excreta in bedding or nests is not
 known.
Similarly, the possibilities of infection associated with ingestion
 of food
contaminated with the virus, contact with mucous membranes, or
 contamination
of breaks in the skin barrier have not been clearly evaluated.
 However,
humans have become infected as a result of rodent bites (18,19). </p>
<p>Most cases of human illness associated with hantaviruses have
 resulted
from exposure to naturally infected wild rodents. Colonized
 laboratory rats
also have been infected with Seoul virus, and animal colony
 employees and
scientists working in disciplines other than microbiology (e.g.,
 physiology
and immunology) have become infected with Seoul virus after being
 exposed to
these animals. Approximately 120 cases of Seoul virus infection
 transmitted
from laboratory rats have been reported from Japan, and other
 instances of
laboratory-acquired infection have been reported from Belgium and
 England
(19-21). Arthropod vectors are not known to transmit hantaviruses
 (12,15).
Person-to-person transmission has not been reported with any of the
 hanta-
viruses primarily associated with HFRS or with the recently
 identified cases
of HPS in the United States. </p>
<p>The difficulty in assaying hantaviruses in material from human
 patients
or wild-caught rodents has constrained efforts to measure
 concentrations of
virus in environmental or clinical samples. Viral genetic material
 has been
detected by RT-PCR in whole blood, lymphocyte fractions, and
 occasionally in
plasma from patients with acute cases of HPS (B. Hjelle, et al.,
 unpublished
data, 1994). </p>
<p>The consequences of infection with the currently recognized
 European-
Asian hantaviruses in humans vary from subclinical seroconversions
 to severe
HFRS. The overall mortality of HPS of 60% includes deaths among
 previously
healthy young persons; subclinical infection appears to be
 uncommon. </p>
<p>In the southwestern United States, rodents occasionally act as
 hosts for
the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague.
 Although fleas
and other ectoparasites are not known to transmit hantaviruses,
 rodent fleas
do transmit plague. Rodent-feeding deer ticks may also transmit the
 etiologic
agent for Lyme disease. Thus, persons who handle field-trapped
 rodents,
rodent sera, rodent tissues, or traps contaminated with rodent
 excreta also
should be aware of the risk for exposure to materials contaminated
 with
hantaviruses and other disease agents. </p>
<p>LABORATORY HAZARDS </p>
<p>Laboratory transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to humans
 via the
aerosol route is well documented (15,16,20,21). Exposures to rodent
 excreta,
fresh necropsy material, and animal bedding are presumed to be
 associated
with risk. In animal holding areas, the period of exposure to
 infectious
animal excreta required for transmission may be short
 (15-17,19-21). Other
potential routes of laboratory infection include ingestion, contact
 of
infectious materials with mucous membranes or broken skin, and, in
particular, animal bites. </p>
<p>Four laboratory workers recently were infected while working
 with cell-
culture-adapted Hantaan virus. Although the procedures associated
 with
infection are unclear, all four persons worked repeatedly with
 hantavirus
cultures and performed centrifugation of concentrated virus (C.
 Schmaljohn,
unpublished data, 1994). </p>
<p>Extensive experience with the hantaviruses that cause HFRS
 indicates that
infection has not been transmitted from patients or clinical
 laboratory
specimens. Similarly, transmission has not been reported from
 patients with
HPS or from related clinical laboratory samples. However, viral
 antigens have
been detected in necropsy specimens, and RT-PCR readily detects
 viral genetic
material (1). Viral RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in blood and
 plasma
obtained early in the course of disease (B. Hjelle, et al.,
 unpublished data,
1994). The implications of these findings for the infectivity of
 blood or
tissues are unknown. </p>
<p>RECOMMENDED PRECAUTIONS </p>
<p>The following recommended biosafety guidelines are based on
 information
regarding known rodent-to-human transmission of hantaviruses, the
 potential
for exposure to aerosolized virus under laboratory conditions, and
 the high
mortality among patients infected with the recently identified U.S.
 virus
(<a href="00031653.htm#00000568.htm">Table_1</a> and <a href="00031653.htm#00000569.htm">Table_2</a>). Biosafety guidelines for
 laboratories and
animal facilities are described in detail in the CDC/ National
 Institutes of
Health publication, Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical
 Laboratories
(22), which specifies the combinations of facilities and safe work
 practices
suitable for handling infectious microorganisms. </p>
<p>Precautions for Handling Specimens from Humans </p>
<p>On the basis of these guidelines, Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2)
 facilities
and BSL-2 practices are recommended for laboratory handling of sera
 from
persons potentially infected with the agents of HPS (<a href="00031653.htm#00000568.htm">Table_1</a>).
 CDC
recommends that universal precautions be followed whenever human
 blood is
handled. The use of a certified biological safety cabinet is
 recommended for
all handling of human body fluids when potential exists for
 splatter or
aerosol. </p>
<p>Precautions for Handling Tissue Samples and Viral Cultures </p>
<p>Potentially infected tissue samples should be handled in BSL-2
 facilities
in accordance with BSL-3 practices (<a href="00031653.htm#00000568.htm">Table_1</a>). Cell-culture
 virus
propagation should be carried out in BSL-3 containment facilities
 in
accordance with BSL-3 practices. Large-scale growth of the virus,
 including
preparing and handling viral concentrates, should be performed in
 BSL-4
containment facilities. </p>
<p>Precautions for Work with Host Species </p>
<p>Experimentally infected rodent species known not to excrete the
 virus can
be housed in animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL-2) facilities in
 accordance with
ABSL-2 practices (<a href="00031653.htm#00000569.htm">Table_2</a>). Biological safety cabinets and
 other physical
containment devices should be used whenever procedures with high
 potential
for generating aerosols are conducted. Serum or tissue samples from
 poten-
tially infected rodents should be handled in accordance with BSL-3
 practices,
although BSL-2 laboratories can be used. </p>
<p>Because of the virulent nature of the agents of HPS and because
 animal-
to-human transmission of hantaviruses may readily occur, persons
 working with
the natural host species should take special precautions. All work
 involving
inoculation of virus-containing samples into P. maniculatus or
 other
permissive species should be conducted at ABSL-4. </p>
<p>CONCLUSION </p>
<p>These guidelines are based on the current knowledge of the
 agents of HPS.
The recommendations outlined in <a href="00031653.htm#00000568.htm">Table_1</a> and <a href="00031653.htm#00000569.htm">Table_2</a> will be
 reviewed
and revised as new information becomes available. Any such revision
 will be
included in the fourth edition of Biosafety in Microbiological and
 Biomedical
Laboratories (22). </p>
